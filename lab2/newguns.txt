crores   xxi    the guns of the gods   xxii    making one hundred exactly   xxiii   three amber moons in a purple sky  xxiv   a hundred guarded it  xxv   and that is the whole story      guns of the gods    out of the ashes  old troy reaped rue in the womb of years for stolen helen s sake  till tenfold retribution rears its wreck on embers slaked with tears that mended no heart ache  the wail of the women sold as slaves lest troy breed sons again dreed o er a desert of nameless graves  the heaps and the hills that are trojan graves deep runneled by the rain   but troy lives on  though helen s rape and ten year hold were vain  though jealous gods with men conspire and furies blast the grecian fire  yet troy must rise again  troy s daughters were a spoil and sport  were limbs for a labor gang  who crooned by foreign loom and mill of trojan loves they cherished still  till homer heard  and sang   they told  by the fire when feasters roared and minstrels waited turns  of the might of the men that troy adored  of the valor in vain of the trojan sword  with the love that slakeless burns  that caught and blazed in the minstrel mind or ever the age of pen  so maids and a minstrel rebuilt troy  out of the ashes they rebuilt troy to live in the hearts of men      yasmini     set down my thoughts not yours if the tale is to be worth the pesa    the why and wherefore of my privilege to write a true account of the princess yasmini s early youth is a story in itself too long to tell here  but it came about through no peculiar wisdom   i fell in a sort of way in love with her  and that led to opportunity   she never made any secret of the scorn with which she regards those who singe wings at her flame   rather she boasts of it with limit overreaching epithets   her respect is reserved for those rare men and women who can meet her in unfair fight and  if not defeat her  then come close to it   she asks no concessions on account of sex   men s passions are but weapons forged for her necessity   and as for genuine love affairs  like cleopatra  she had but two  and the second ended in disaster to herself   this tale is of the first one that succeeded  although fraught with discontent for certain others   the second affair came close to whelming thrones  and i wrote of that in another book with an understanding due  as i have said  to opportunity  and with a measure of respect that pleased her   she is habitually prompt and generous with her rewards  if far seeing in bestowal of them   so  during the days of her short political eclipse that followed in a palace that had housed a hundred kings  i saw her almost daily in a room  her holy of holies  where the gods of ancient india were depicted in three primal colors working miracles all over the walls and where  if governments had only known it  she was already again devising plans to set the world on fire   there  amid an atmosphere of indian scents and cigarette smoke  she talked and i made endless notes  while now and then  when she was meditative  her maids sang to an accompaniment of rather melancholy wooden flutes   but whenever i showed a tendency to muse she grew indignant    of what mud are you building castles now   set down my thoughts not yours   she insisted   if your tale is to be worth the pesa    by that she referred to the custom of all eastern story tellers to stop at the exciting moment and take up a collection of the country s smallest copper coins before finishing the tale   but the reference was double edged  a penny for my thoughts  a penny for the west s interpretation of the east was what she had in mind   nevertheless  as it is to the west that the story must appeal it has seemed wiser to remove it from her lips and so transpose that  though it loses in lore unfortunately  it does gain something of directness and simplicity  her satire  and most of her metaphor if always set down as she phrased it  would scandalize as well as puzzle western ears   this tale is of her youth  but yasmini s years have not yet done more than ripen her   in a land where most women shrivel into early age she continues  somewhere perhaps a little after thirty  in the bloom of health and loveliness  younger in looks and energy than many a western girl of twenty five   for she is of the east and west  very terribly endowed with all the charms of either and the brains of both   her quick wit can detect or invent mercurial asian subterfuge as swiftly as appraise the rather glacial drift of western thought   and the wisdom of both east and west combines in her to teach a very nearly total incredulity in human virtue   western morals she regards as humbug  neither more nor less   in virtue itself she believes  as astronomers for example believe in the precession of the equinox   but that the rank and file of human beings  and especially learned human beings  have attained to the very vaguest understanding of it she scornfully disbelieves   and with a frankness simply gallic in its freedom from those thought conventions with which so many people like to deceive themselves she deals with human nature on what she considers are its merits   the result is sometimes very disconcerting to the pompous and all the rest of the host of self deceived  but usually amusing to herself and often profitable to her friends   her ancestry is worth considering  since to that she doubtless owes a good proportion of her beauty and ability   on her father s side she is rajput  tracing her lineage so far back that it becomes lost at last in fabulous legends of the moon  who is masculine  by the way  in indian mythology    all of the great families of rajputana are her kin  and all the chivalry and derring do of that royal land of heroines and heroes is part of her conscious heritage   her mother was russian   on that side  too  she can claim blood royal  not devoid of at least a trace of scandinavian  betrayed by glittering golden hair and eyes that are sometimes the color of sky seen over himalayan peaks  sometimes of the deep lake water in the valleys   but very often her eyes seem so full of fire and their color is so baffling that a legend has gained currency to the effect that she can change their hue at will   how a russian princess came to marry a rajput king is easier to understand if one recalls the sinister designs of russian statecraft in the days when india and  warm sea water  was the great objective   the oldest  and surely the easiest  means of a perplexed diplomacy has been to send a woman to undermine the policy of courts or steal the very consciences of kings   delilah is a case in point   and in india  where the veil and the rustling curtain and religion hide woman s hand without in the least suppressing her  that was a plan too easy of contrivance to be overlooked   in those days there was a prince in moscow whose public conduct so embittered his young wife  and so notoriously  that when he was found one morning murdered in his bed suspicion rested upon her   she was tried in secret  as the custom was  found guilty and condemned to death  then  on the strength of influence too strong for the czar  the sentence was commuted to the far more cruel one of life imprisonment in the siberian mines   while she awaited the dreaded march across asia in chains a certain proposal was made to the princess sonia omanoff  and no one who knew anything about it wondered that she accepted without much hesitation   less than a month after her arrest she was already in paris  squandering paper rubles in the fashionable shops   and at the russian embassy in paris she made the acquaintance of the very first of the smaller indian potentates who made the  grand tour    traveling abroad has since become rather fashionable  and is even encouraged by the british indian government because there is no longer any plausible means of preventing it  but maharajah bubru singh was a pioneer  who dared greatly  and had his way even against the objections of a high commissioner   in addition he had had to defy the brahman priests who  all unwilling  are the strong supports of alien overrule   for they are armed with the iron fanged laws of caste that forbid crossing the sea  among innumerable other things   perhaps there was a hint of moral bravery behind the warrior eyes that was enough in itself and she really fell in love at first sight  as men said  but the secret police of russia were at her elbow  too  hinting that only one course could save her from extradition and siberian mines   at any rate she listened to the rajah s wooing   and the knowledge that he had a wife at home already  a little past her prime perhaps and therefore handicapped in case of rivalry  but never the less a prior wife  seems to have given her no pause   the fact that the first wife was childless doubtless influenced bubru singh   they even say she was so far beside herself with love for him that she would have been satisfied with the gandharva marriage ceremony sung by so many rajput poets  that amounts to little more than going off alone together   but the russian diplomatic scheme included provision for the maharajah of a wife so irrevocably wedded that the british would not be able to refuse her recognition   so they were married in the presence of seven witnesses in the russian embassy  as the records testify   after that  whatever its suspicions  the british government had to admit her into rajputana   and what politics she might have played  whether the russian gray coat armies might have encroached into those historic hills on the strength of her intriguing  or whether she would have seized the first opportunity to avenge herself by playing russia false   are matters known only to the gods of unaccomplished things   for bubru singh  her maharajah  died of an accident very shortly after the birth of their child yasmini   now law is law  and sonia omanoff  then legally the princess sonia singh  had appealed from the first to indian law and custom  so that the british might have felt justified in leaving her and her infant daughter to its most untender mercies   then she would have been utterly under the heel of the succeeding prince  a nephew of her husband  unenamored of foreigners and avowedly determined to enforce on his uncle s widow the indian custom of seclusion   but the british took the charitable view  that covering a multitude of sins  it was not bad policy to convert the erstwhile sonia omanoff from secret enemy to grateful friend  and the feat was easy   the new maharajah  gungadhura singh  was prevailed on to assign an ancient palace for the russian widow s use   and there  almost within sight of the royal seraglio from which she had been ousted  yasmini had her bringing up  regaled by her mother with tales of western outrage and ambition  and well schooled in all that pertained to her eastern heritage by the thousand and one intriguers whose delight and livelihood it is to fish the troubled waters of the courts of minor kings   all these things yasmini told me in that scented chamber of another palace  in which a wrathful government secluded her in later years for its own peace as it thought  but for her own recuperation as it happened  she told me many other things besides that have some little bearing on this story but that  if all related  would crowd the book too full   the real gist of them is that she grew to love india with all her heart and india repaid her for it after its own fashion  which is manyfold and marvelous   there is no fairer land on earth than that far northern slice of rajputana  nor a people more endowed with legend and the consciousness of ancestry   they have a saying that every rajput is a king s son  and every rajputni worthy to be married to an emperor   it was in that atmosphere that yasmini learned she must either use her wits or be outwitted  and women begin young to assert their genius in the east   but she outstripped precocity and  being western too  rode rough shod on convention when it suited her  reserving her concessions to it solely for occasions when those matched the hand she held   all her life she has had to play in a ruthless game  but the trump that she has learned to lead oftenest is unexpectedness   and now to the story       chapter one    royal rajasthan  there is a land where no resounding street with babel of electric garish night and whir of endless wheels has put to flight the liberty of leisure   sandaled feet and naked soles that feel the friendly dust go easily along the never measured miles  a land at which the patron tourist smiles because of gods in whom those people trust  he boasting one and trusting not at all   a land where lightning is the lover s boon  and honey oozing from an amber moon illumines footing on forbidden wall  where   stead of pursy jeweler s display  parading peacocks brave the passer by  and swans like angels in an azure sky wing swift and silent on unchallenged way  no land of fable   of the hills i sing  whose royal women tread with conscious grace the peace filled gardens of a warrior race  each maiden fit for wedlock with a king  and every rajput son so royal born and conscious of his age long heritage he looks askance at burke s becrested page and wonders at the new ennobled scorn  i sing  for this is earth  of hate and guile  of tyranny and trick and broken pledge  of sudden weapons  and the thrice keen edge of woman s wit  the sting in woman s smile  but also of the heaven fathomed glow  the sweetness and the charm and dear delight of loyal woman  humorous and right  pure purposed as the bosom of the snow   no tale  then  this of motors  but of men with camels fleeter than the desert wind  who come and go  so leave the west behind  and  at the magic summons of the pen forgetting new contentions if you will  take wings  take silent wings of time untied  and see  with fellow friendship for your guide  a little how the east goes wooing still      gold is where you find it    dawn at the commencement of hot weather in the hills if not the loveliest of india s wealth of wonders  for there is the moon by night  is fair preparation for whatever cares to follow   there is a musical silence cut of which the first voices of the day have birth   and a half light holding in its opalescence all the colors that the day shall use   a freshness and serenity to hint what might be if the sons of men were wise enough  and beauty unbelievable   the fortunate sleep on roofs or on verandas  to be ready for the sweet cool wind that moves in advance of the rising sun  caused  as some say  by the wing beats of departing spirits of the night   so that in that respect the mangy jackals  the monkeys  and the chandala  who are the lowest human caste of all and quite untouchable by the other people the creator made  are most to be envied   for there is no stuffy screen  and small convention  between them and enjoyment of the blessed air   next in order of defilement to the sweepers   or  as some particularly righteous folk with inside reservations on the road to heaven firmly insist  even beneath the sweepers  and possibly beneath the jackals  come the english  looking boldly on whatever their eyes desire and tasting out of curiosity the fruit of more than one forbidden tree  but obsessed by an amazing if perverted sense of duty   they rule the land  largely by what they idolize as  luck   which consists of tolerance for things they do not understand   understanding one another rather well  they are more merciless to their own offenders than is brahman to chandala  for they will hardly let them live   but they are a people of destiny  and india has prospered under them   in among the english something after the fashion of grace notes in the bars of music  enlivening  if sharp at times  come occasional americans  turning up in unexpected places for unusual reasons  and remaining   because it is no man s business to interfere with them   unlike the english  who approach all quarters through official doors and never trespass without authority  the americans have an embarrassing way of choosing their own time and step  taking officialdom  so to speak  in flank   it is to the credit of the english that they overlook intrusion that they would punish fiercely if committed by unauthorized folk from home   so when the blaines  husband and wife  came to sialpore in rajputana without as much as one written introduction  nobody snubbed them  and when  by dint of nothing less than nerve nor more than ability to recognize their opportunity  they acquired the lease of the only vacant covetable house nobody was very jealous  especially when the blaines proved hospitable   it was a sweet little nest of a house with a cool stone roof  set in a rather large garden of its own on the shoulder of the steep hill that overlooks the city   a political dependent of yasmini s father had built it as a haven for his favorite paramour when jealousy in his seraglio had made peace at home impossible   being connected with the treasury in some way  and suitably dishonest  he had been able to make a luxurious pleasaunce of it   and he had taste   but when yasmini s father died and his nephew gungadhura succeeded him as maharajah he made a clean sweep of the old pension and employment list in order to enrich new friends  so the little nest on the hill became deserted   its owner went into exile in a neighboring state and died there out of reach of the incoming politician who naturally wanted to begin business by exposing the scandalous remissness of his predecessor   the house was acquired on a falling market by a money lender  who eventually leased it to the blaines on an eighty per cent  basis   a price that satisfied them entirely until they learned later about local proportion   the front veranda faced due east  raised above the garden by an eight foot wall  an ideal place for sleep because of the unfailing morning breeze  the beds were set there side by side each evening  and mrs  blaine   a full ten years younger than her husband  formed a habit of rising in the dark and standing in her night dress  with bare feet on the utmost edge of the top stone step  to watch for the miracle of morning   she was fabulously pretty like that  with her hair blowing and her young figure outlined through the linen   and she was sometimes unobserved   the garden wall  a hundred feet beyond  was of rock  two and a half men high  as they measure the unleapable in that distrustful land   but the blaines  hailing from a country where a neighbor s dog and chickens have the run of twenty lawns  seldom took the trouble to lock the little  arched  iron studded door through which the former owner had come and gone unobserved   the use of an open door is hardly trespass under the law of any land   and dawn is an excellent time for the impecunious who take thought of the lily how it grows in order to outdo solomon   when a house changes hands in rajputana there pass with it  as well as the rats and cobras and the mongoose  those beggars who were wont to plague the former owner   that is a custom so based on ancient logic that the english  who appreciate conservatism  have not even tried to alter it   so when a cracked voice broke the early stillness out of shadow where the garden wall shut off the nearer view  theresa blaine paid small attention to it    memsahib   protectress of the poor    she continued watching the mystery of coming light   the ancient city s domed and pointed roofs already glistened with pale gold  and a pearly mist wreathed the crowded quarter of the merchants   beyond that the river  not more than fifty yards wide  flowed like molten sapphire between unseen banks   as the pale stars died  thin rays of liquid silver touched the surface of a lake to westward  seen through a rift between purple hills   the green of irrigation beyond the river to eastward shone like square cut emeralds  and southward the desert took to itself all imaginable hues at once    colorado   she said then    and arizona   and southern california  and something added that i can t just place     sin s added by the scow load   growled her husband from the farther bed   come back  tess  and put some clothes on    she turned her head to smile  but did not move away   hearing the man s voice  the owners of other voices piped up at once from the shadow  all together  croaking out of tune    bhig mangi shahebi   bhig mangi shahebi     alms   alms     i can see wild swans   said theresa    come and look  five  six  seven of them  flying northward  oh  ever so high up     put some clothes on  tess     i m plenty warm     maybe   but there s some skate looking at you from the garden   what s the matter with your kimono    however the dawn wind was delicious  and the night gown more decent than some of the affairs they label frocks   besides  the east is used to more or less nakedness and thinks no evil of it  as women learn quicker than men    all right  in a minute     i ll bet there s a speculator charging  em admission at the gate   grumbled dick blaine  coming to stand beside her in pajamas    sure you re right  tess   those are swans  and that s a dawn worth seeing    he had the deep voice that the east attributes to manliness  and the muscular mold that never came of armchair criticism   she looked like a child beside him  though he was agile  athletic  wiry  not enormous    sahib   resumed the voices    sahib   protector of the poor    they whined out of darkness still  but the shadow was shortening    better feed  em  tess   a man s starved down mighty near the knuckle if he ll wake up this early to beg     nonsense   those are three regular bums who look on us as their preserve  they enjoy the morning as much as we do   begging s their way of telling people howdy     somebody pays them to come   he grumbled  helping her into a pale blue kimono   tess laughed    sure   but it pays us too   they keep other bums away  i talk to them sometimes     in english     i don t think they know any   i m learning their language    it was his turn to laugh    i knew a man once who learned the gipsy bolo on a bet   before he d half got it you couldn t shoo tramps off his door step with a gun   after a time he grew to like it  flattered him  i suppose  but decent folk forgot to ask him to their corn roasts   careful  tess  or sialpore ll drop us from its dinner lists     don t you believe it   they re crazy to learn american from me  and to hear your cowpuncher talk   we re social lions   i think they like us as much as we like them   don t make that face  dick  one maverick isn t a whole herd  and you can t afford to quarrel with the commissioner    he chose to change the subject    what are your bums  names   he asked    funny names   bimbu  umra and pinga   now you can see them  look  the shadow s gone   bimbu is the one with no front teeth  umra has only one eye  and pinga winks automatically   wait till you see pinga smile  it s diagonal instead of horizontal   must have hurt his mouth in an accident     probably he and bimbu fought and found the biting tough   speaking of dogs  strikes me we ought to keep a good big fierce one   be added suggestively    no  no  dick  there s no danger   besides  there s chamu     the bums could make short work of that parasite     i m safe enough   tom tripe usually looks in at least once a day when you re gone     tom s a good fellow  but once a day     a hundred things might happen  i d better speak to tom tripe about those three bums  he ll shift them     don t  dick   i tell you they keep others away   look  here comes chamu with the chota hazri    clad in an enormous turban and clean white linen from head to foot  a stout hindu appeared  superintending a tall meek underling who carried the customary  little breakfast  of the country  fruit  biscuits and the inevitable tea that haunts all british byways   as soon as the underling had spread a cloth and arranged the cups and plates chamu nudged him into the background and stood to receive praise undivided   the salaams done with and his own dismissal achieved with proper dignity  chamu drove the hamal away in front of him  and cuffed him the minute they were out of sight   there was a noise of repeated blows from around the corner    a big dog might serve better after all   mused tess    chamu beats the servants  and takes commissions  even from the beggars     how do you know     they told me     um  bing and ping would better keep away   there s no obligation to camp here     only  if we fired chamu i suppose the maharajah would be offended  he made such a great point of sending us a faithful servant     true   gungadhura singh is a suspicious rajah   he suspects me anyway  i screwed better terms out of him than the miller got from bob white  and now whenever he sees me off the job he suspects me of chicanery  if we fired chamu he d think i d found the gold and was trying to hide it  say  if i don t find gold in his blamed hills eventually       you ll find it  dick   you never failed at anything you really set your heart on  with your experience      experience doesn t count for much   he answered  blowing at his tea to cool it    it s not like coal or manganese   gold is where you find it  there are no rules     finding it s your trade   go ahead     i m not afraid of that   what eats me   he said  standing up and looking down at her   is what i ve heard about their passion for revenge   every one has the same story   if you disappoint them  gee whiz  look out  poisoning your wife s a sample of what they ll do   it s crossed my mind a score of times  little girl  that you ought to go back to the states and wait there till i m through     she stood on tiptoe and kissed him    isn t that just like a man     all the same      go in  dick  and get dressed  or the sun will be too high before you get the gang started    she took his arm and they went into the house together   twenty minutes later he rode away on his pony  looking if possible even more of an athlete than in his pajamas  for there was an added suggestion of accomplishment in the rolled up sleeves and scarred boots laced to the knee   their leave taking was a purely american episode  mixed of comradeship  affection and just plain foolishness  witnessed by more wondering  patient indian eyes than they suspected   every move that either of them made was always watched   as a matter of fact chamu s attention was almost entirely taken up just then by the crows  iniquitous black humorists that took advantage of turned backs  for tess walked beside the pony to the gate  to rifle the remains of chota hazri  one of them flying off with a spoon since the rest had all the edibles   chamu threw a cushion at the spoon thief and called him  balibuk   which means eater of the temple offerings  and is an insult beyond price    that s the habit of crows   he explained indignantly to tess as she returned  laughing  to the veranda  picking up the cushion on her way   they are without shame  garud  who is king of all the birds  should turn them into fish   then they could swim in water and be caught with hooks   but first blaine sahib should shoot them with a shotgun    having offered that wise solution of the problem chamu stood with fat hands folded on his stomach    the crows steal less than some people   tess answered pointedly   he preferred to ignore the remark    or there might be poison added to some food  and the food left for them to see   he suggested  whereat she astonished him  american women being even more incomprehensible than their english cousins    if you talk to me about poison i ll send you back to gungadhura in disgrace   take away the breakfast things at once     that is the hamal s business   he retorted pompously    the maharajah sahib is knowing me for most excellent butler   he himself has given me already very high recommendation   will he permit opinions of other people to contradict him    the words  opinions of women  had trembled on his lips but intuition saved that day   it flashed across even his obscene mentality that he might suggest once too often contempt for western folk who worked for eastern potentates   it was true he regarded the difference between a contract and direct employment as merely a question of degree  and a quibble in any case  and he felt pretty sure that the blaines would not risk the maharajah s unchancy friendship by dismissing himself  but he suspected there were limits   he could not imagine why  but he had noticed that insolence to blaine himself was fairly safe  blaine being super humanly indifferent as long as mrs  blaine was shown respect  even exceeding the english in the absurd length to which he carried it  it was a mad world in chamu s opinion   he went and fetched the hamal  who slunk through his task with the air of a condemned felon   tess smiled at the man for encouragement  but chamu s instant jealousy was so obvious that she regretted the mistake    now call up the beggars and feed them   she ordered    feed them   they will not eat   it is contrary to caste     nonsense   they have no caste   bring bread and feed them     there is no bread of the sort they will eat     i know exactly what you mean   if i give them bread there s no profit for you  they ll eat it all   but if i give them money you ll exact a commission from them of one pesa in five   isn t that so   go and bring the bread    he decided to turn the set back into at any rate a minor victory and went in person to the kitchen for chupatties such as the servants ate   then  returning to the top of the steps he intimated that the earth defilers might draw near and receive largesse  contriving the impression that it was by his sole favor the concession was obtained   two of them came promptly and waited at the foot of the steps  smirking and changing attitudes to draw attention to their rags   chamu tossed the bread to them with expressions of disgust   if they had cared to pretend they were holy men he would have been respectful  in degree at least  but these were professionals so hardened that they dared ignore the religious apology  which implies throughout the length and breadth of india the right to beg from place to place   these were not even true vagabonds  but rogues contented with one victim in one place as long as benevolence should last    where is the third one   tess demanded    where is pinga    they professed not to know  but she had seen all three squatting together close to the little gate five minutes before   she ordered chamu to go and find the missing man and he waddled off  grumbling   at the end of five minutes he returned without him    one comes on horseback   he announced   who gave the third beggar money  so that he now waits outside     what for     who knows   perhaps to keep watch     to watch for what     who knows     who is it on horseback   a caller   some one coming for breakfast  you d better hurry    the call at breakfast time is one of the pleasantest informalities of life in india   it might even be the commissioner   tess ran to make one of those swift changes of costume with which some women have the gift of gracing every opportunity   chamu waddled down the steps to await with due formality  the individual  in no way resembling a british commissioner  who was leisurely dismounting at the wide gate fifty yards to the southward of that little one the beggars used   he was a rajput of rajputs  thin wristed  thin ankled  lean  astonishingly handsome in a high bred northern way  and possessed of that air of utter self assuredness devoid of arrogance which people seem able to learn only by being born to it   his fine features were set off by a turban of rose pink silk  and the only fault discoverable as he strode up the path between the shrubs was that his riding boots seemed too tight across the instep   there was not a vestige of hair on his face   he was certainly less than twenty  perhaps seventeen years old  or even younger  ages are hard to guess in that land   tess was back on the veranda in time to receive him  with different shoes and stockings  and another ribbon in her hair   few men would have noticed the change at all  although agreeably conscious of the daintiness   the rajput seemed unable to look away from her but ignoring chamu  as he came up the steps  appraised her inch by inch from the white shoes upward until as he reached the top their eyes met  chamu followed him fussily   tess could not remember ever having seen such eyes   they were baffling by their quality of brilliance  unlike the usual slumbrous eastern orbs that puzzle chiefly by refusal to express emotion   the rajput bowed and said nothing  so tess offered him a chair  which chamu drew up more fussily than ever    have you had breakfast   she asked  taking the conscious risk   strangers of alien race are not invariably good guests  however good looking  especially when one s husband is somewhere out of call   she looked and felt nearly as young as this man  and had already experienced overtures from more than one young prince who supposed he was doing her an honor   used to closely guarded women s quarters  the east wastes little time on wooing when the barriers are passed or down  but she felt irresistibly curious  and after all there was chamu    thanks  i took breakfast before dawn    the rajput accepted the proffered chair without acknowledging the butler s existence   tess passed him the big silver cigarette box    then let me offer you a drink    he declined both drink and cigarette and there was a minute s silence during which she began to grow uncomfortable    i was riding after breakfast  up there on the hill where you see that overhanging rock  when i caught sight of you here on the veranda  you  too  were watching the dawn  beautiful   i love the dawn   so i thought i would come and get to know you   people who love the same thing  you know  are not exactly strangers    almost  if not quite for the first time tess grew very grateful for chamu  who was still hovering at hand    if my husband had known  he would have stayed to receive you     oh  no  i took good care for that   i continued my ride until after i knew he had gone for the day    things dawn on your understanding in the east one by one  as the stars come out at night  until in the end there is such a bewildering number of points of light that people talk about the  incomprehensible east    tess saw light suddenly    do you mean that those three beggars are your spies    the rajput nodded   then his bright eyes detected the instant resolution that tess formed    but you must not be afraid of them   they will be very useful  often     how    the visitor made a gesture that drew attention to chamu    your butler knows english   do you know russian     not a word     french     very little     if we were alone     tess decided to face the situation boldly   she came from a free land  and part of her heritage was to dare meet any man face to face   but intuition combined with curiosity to give her confidence    chamu  you may go    the butler waddled out of sight  but the rajput waited until the sound of his retreating footsteps died away somewhere near the kitchen   then    you feel afraid of me   he asked    not at all   why should i   why do you wish to see me alone     i have decided you are to be my friend   are you not pleased     but i don t know anything about you   suppose you tell me who you are and tell me why you use beggars to spy on my husband     those who have great plans make powerful enemies  and fight against odds   i make friends where i can  and instruments even of my enemies  you are to be my friend     you look very young to     suddenly tess saw light again  and the discovery caused her pupils to contract a little and then dilate   the rajput noticed it  and laughed  then  leaning forward    how did vou know i am a woman   tell me   i must know   i shall study to act better    tess leaned back entirely at her ease at last and looked up at the sky  rather reveling in relief and in the fun of turning the tables    please tell me   i must know     oh  one thing and another   it isn t easy to explain   for one thing  your insteps     i will get other boots   what else   i make no lap   i hold my hands as a man does   is my voice too high  too excitable     no   there are men with voices like yours   there s a long golden hair on your shoulder that might  of course  belong to some one else  but your ears are pierced      so are many men s     and you have blue eyes  and long fair lashes   i ve seen occasional rajput men with blue eyes  too  but your teeth  much too perfect for a man     for a young man     perhaps not   but add one thing to another      there is something else   tell me     you remember when you called attention to the butler before i dismissed him   no man could do that   you re a woman and you can dance     so it is my shoulders   i will study again before the mirror   yes  i can dance   soon you shall see me   you shall see all the most wonderful things in rajputana     but tell me about yourself   tess insisted  offering the cigarettes again  and this time her guest accepted one    my mother was the russian wife of bubru singh  who had no son  i am the rightful maharanee of sialpore  only those fools of english put my father s  nephew on the throne  saying a woman can not reign   they are no wiser than apes   they have given sialpore to gungadhura who is a pig and loathes them instead of to a woman who would only laugh at them  and the brute is raising a litter of little pigs  so that even if he and his progeny were poisoned one by one  there would always be a brat left  he has so many     and you     first you must promise silence     very well     woman to woman     yes     womb to womb  heart to heart       on my word of honor   but i promise nothing else  remember     so speaks one whose promises are given truly   we are already friends  i will tell you all that is in my heart now     tell me your name first    she was about to answer when interruption came from the direction of the gate   there was a restless horse there  and a rider using resonant strong language    tom tripe   said tess    he s earlier than usual    the rajputni smiled   chamu appeared through the door behind them with suspicious suddenness and waddled to the gate  watched by a pair of blue eyes that should have burned holes in his back and would certainly have robbed him of all comfort had he been aware of them       chapter two  thaw on olympus  bright spurs that add their roweled row to clanking saber s pride  fierce eyes beneath a beetling brow  more license than the rules allow  a military stride  years  use of arbitrary will and right to make or break  obedience of men who drill and willy nilly foot the bill for authorized mistake  the comfort of the self esteem deputed power brings   are fickler than the shadows seem less fruitful than the lotus dream  and all of them have wings when blue eyes  laughing in your own  make mockery of rules   and when those fustian shams have flown the wise their new allegiance own  leaving dead form to fools     friendship s friendship and respect s respect  but duty s what i m paid to do    the man at the gate dallied to look at his horse s fetlocks   tess s strange guest seemed in no hurry either  but her movements were as swift as knitting needles   she produced a fountain pen  and of all unexpected things  a bank of india note for one thousand rupees  a new one  crisp and clean   tess did not see the signature she scrawled across its back in persian characters  and the pen was returned to an inner pocket and the note  folded four times  was palmed in the subtle hand long before tom tripe came striding up the path with jingling spurs    morning  ma am   morning   don t let me intrude   i d a little accident  and took a liberty   my horse cut his fetlock  nothing serious  and i set your two saises  grooms  to work on it with a sponge and water  twenty minutes  will see it right as a trivet   then i m off again  i ve a job of work    he stood with back to the sun and hands on his hips  looking up at tess   a man of fifty  a soldier of another generation  in a white uniform something like a british sergeant major s of the days before the mutiny   his mutton chop whiskers  dyed dark brown  were military mid victorian  as were the huge brass spurs that jingled on black riding boots   a great chested  heavy weight athletic man  a few years past his prime    come up  tom   you re always welcome     ah    his spurs rang on the stone steps  and  since tess was standing close to the veranda rail  he turned to face her at the top   saluting with martinet precision before removing his helmet  he did not get a clear view of the rajputni    as i ve said many times  ma am  the one house in the world where tom tripe may sit down with princes and commissioners     have you had breakfast    he made a wry face    the old story  tom     the old story  ma am   a hair of the dog that bit me is all the breakfast i could swallow     i suppose if i don t give you one now you ll have two later    he nodded   i must   one now would put me just to rights and i d eat at noon   times when i m savage with myself  and wait  i have to have two or three before i can stomach lunch    she offered him a basket chair and beckoned chamu    brandy and soda for the sahib     thank you  ma am   said the soldier piously    where s your dog  tom     behaving himself  i hope  ma am  out there in the sun by the gate     call him   he shall have a bone on the veranda   i want him to feel as friendly here as you do    tom whistled shrilly and an ash hued creature  part great dane and certainly part rampore  came up the path like a catapulted phantom  making hardly any sound   he stopped at the foot of the steps and gazed inquiringly at his master s face    you may come up    he was an extraordinary animal  enormous  big jowled  scarred  ungainly and apparently aware of it   he paused again on the top step    show your manners    the beast walked toward tess  sniffed at her  wagged his stern exactly once and retired to the other end of the veranda  where chamu  hurrying with brandy gave him the widest possible berth   tess looked the other way while tom tripe helped himself to a lot of brandy and a little soda    now get a big bone for the dog   she ordered    there is none   the butler answered    bring the leg of mutton bone of yesterday     that is for soup today     bring it    chamu was standing between tom tripe and the rajputni  with his back to the latter  so nobody saw the hand that slipped something into the ample folds of his sash   he departed muttering by way of the steps and the garden  and the dog growled acknowledgment of the compliment   tess s rajput guest continued to say nothing   but made no move to go  introduction was inevitable  for it was the first rule of that house that all ranks met there on equal terms  whatever their relations elsewhere  tom tripe had finished wiping his mustache  and tess was still wondering just how to manage without betraying the sex of the other or the fact that she herself did not yet know her visitor s name  when chamu returned with the bone   he threw it to the dog from a safe distance  and was sniffed at scornfully for his pains    won t he take it   asked tess    not from a black man   bring it here  you    the great brute  with a sidewise growl and glare at the butler that made him sweat with fright  picked up the bone and  at a sign from his master  laid it at the feet of tess    show your manners    once more he waved his stern exactly once    give it to him  ma am    tess touched the bone with her foot  and the dog took it away  scaring chamu along the veranda in front of him    why don t you ever call him by name  tom     bad for him  ma am   when i say   here  you   or whistle  he obeys quick as lightning   but if i say   trotters   which his name is  he knows he s got to do his own thinking  and keeps his distance till he s sure what s wanted   a dog s like an enlisted man  ma am   ought to be taught to jump at the word of command and never think for himself until you call him out of the ranks by name   trotters understands me perfectly     speaking of names   said tess   i d like to introduce you to my guest  tom  but i m afraid      you may call me gunga singh   said a quiet voice full of amusement  and tom tripe started   he turned about in his chair and for the first time looked the third member of the party in the face    hoity toity   well  i m jiggered   dash my drink and dinner  it s the princess    he rose and saluted cavalierly  jocularly  yet with a deference one could not doubt  showing tobacco darkened teeth in a smile of almost paternal indulgence    so the princess yasmini is gunga singh this morning  eh   and here s tom tripe riding up hill and down dale  laming his horse and sweating through a clean tunic  with a threat in his ear and a reward promised that he ll never see a smell of  while the princess is smoking cigarettes      in very good company     in good company  aye   but not out of mischief  i ll be bound   naughty  naughty   he said  wagging a finger at her    your ladyship ll get caught one of these days  and where will tom tripe be then   i ve got my job to keep  you know   friendship s friendship and respect s respect  but duty s what i m paid to do   here s me  drill master of the maharajah s troops and a pension coming to me consequent on good behavior  with orders to set a guard over you  miss  and prevent your going and coming without his highness  leave   and here s you giving the guard the slip   somebody tipped his highness off  and i wish you d heard what s going to happen to me unless i find you     you can t find me  tom tripe   i m not yasmini today   i m gunga singh     tut tut  your ladyship   that won t do   i swore on my bible oath to the maharajah that i left you day before yesterday closely guarded in the palace across the river   he felt easy for the first time for a week   now  because they re afraid for their skins  the guard all swear by krishna you were never in there  and that i ve been bribed   how did you get out of the grounds  miss     climbed the wall     i might have remembered you re as active as a cat   next time i ll mount a double guard on the wall  so they ll tumble off and break their necks if they fall asleep   but there are no boats  for i saw to it  and the bridge is watched   how did you cross the river     swam     at night    the blue eyes smiled assent    missy  your ladyship  you mustn t do that   little ladies that act that way might lose the number of their mess   there s crockadowndillies in that river  aggilators  what d ye call the damp things   mugger   they snap their jaws on a leg and pull you under   the sweeter and prettier you are the more they like you   besides  missy  princesses aren t supposed to swim   it s vulgar    he contrived to look the very incarnation of offended prudery  and she laughed at him with a voice like a golden bell   he faced tess again with a gesture of apology    you ll pardon me  ma am  but duty s duty    tess was enjoying the play immensely  shrewdly suspecting tom tripe of more complaisance than he chose to admit to his prisoner    you must treat my house as a sanctuary  tom   outside the garden wall orders i suppose are orders   inside it i insist all guests are free and equal    the princess yasmini slapped her boot with a little riding switch and laughed delightedly    there  tom tripe   now what will you do     i ll have to use persuasion  miss   tell me how you got into your own palace unseen and out again with a horse without a soul knowing      come into my net and get caught   said the hunter   but the leopard is still at large    teach me your tracks   begged the hunter   but the leopard answered   learn them       hell s bells    tom tripe scratched his head and wiped sweat from his collar   the princess was gazing away into the distance  not apparently inclined to take the soldier seriously   tess  wondering what her guest found interesting on the horizon all of a sudden  herself picked out the third beggar s shabby outline on the same high rock from which yasmini had confessed to watching before dawn    will your ladyship ride home with me   asked tom tripe    no     but why not     because the commissioner is coming and there is only one road and he would see me and ask questions   he is stupid enough not to recognize me  but you are too stupid to tell wise lies  and this memsahib is so afraid of an imaginary place called hell that i must stay and do my own      i left off believing in hell when i was ten years old   tess answered    i hope to god you re right  ma am   put in tom tripe piously  and both women laughed    then i shall trust you and we shall always understand each other   decided yasmini    but why will you not tell lies  if there is no hell     i m afraid i m guilty now and then     but you are ashamed afterward   why   lies are necessary  since people are such fools    tom tripe interrupted  wiping the inside of his tunic collar again with a big bandanna handkerchief    how do you know the commissioner is coming  your ladyship   phew  you d better hide   i ll have to answer too many questions as it is   he d turn you outside in     there is no hurry   said yasmini    he will not be here for five minutes and he is a fool in any case   he is walking his horse up hill    tess too had seen the beggar on the rock remove his ragged turban  rewind it  and then leisurely remove himself from sight   the system of signals was pretty obviously simple   the whole intriguing east is simple  if one only has simplicity enough to understand it    can your horse be seen from the road   yasmini asked    no  miss   the saises are attending to him under the neem trees at the rear     then ask the memsahib s permission to pass through the house and leave by the back way    tess  more amused than ever  nodded consent and clapped her hands for chamu to come and do the honors    i ll wait here   she said   and welcome the commissioner     but you  your ladyship   tom tripe scratched his head in evident confusion    i ve got to account for you  you know     you haven t seen me   you have only seen a man named gunga singh     that s all very fine  missy  but the butler  that man chamu  he knows you well enough   he ll get the story to the maharajah s ears     leave that to me     you dassen t trust him  miss    again came the golden laugh  expressive of the worldly wisdom of a thousand women  and sheer delight in it    i shall stay here  if the memsahib permits    tess nodded again    the commissioner shall sit with me on the veranda   tess said    chamu will show you into the parlor     the blaines had never made the least attempt to leave behind their home grown names for things   whoever wanted to in sialpore might have a drawing room  but whoever came to that house must sit in a parlor or do the other thing     is it possible the burra sahib will suppose my horse is yours   yasmini asked  and again tess smiled and nodded   she would know what to say to any one who asked impertinent questions   yasmini and tom tripe followed chamu into the house just as the commissioner s horse s nose appeared past the gate post   and once behind the curtains in the long hall that divided room from room  tom tripe called a halt to make a final effort at persuasion    now  missy  your ladyship  please    but she had no patience to spare for him    quick   send your dog to guard that door    tom tripe snapped his fingers and made a motion with his right hand  the dog took up position full in the middle of the passage blocking the way to the kitchen and alert for anything at all  but violence preferred  chamu  all sly smiles and effusiveness until that instant  as one who would like to be thought a confidential co conspirator  now suddenly realized that his retreat was cut off   no explanation had been offered  but the fact was obvious and conscience made the usual coward of him  he would rather have bearded tom tripe than the dog   yasmini opened on him in his own language  because there was just a chance that otherwise tess might overhear through the open window and put two and two together    scullion   dish breaker   conveyor of uncleanness   you have a son     truly  heavenborn   one son  who grows into a man  the treasure of my old heart     a gambler     a young man  heavenborn  who feels his manhood  now and then gay  now and then foolish      a budmash    bad rascal     nay  an honest one     who borrowed from mukhum dass the money lender  making untrue promises     nay  the money was to pay a debt     a gambling debt  and he lied about it     nay  truly  heavenborn  he but promised mukhum dass he would repay the sum with interest     swearing he would buy with the money  two horses which mukhum dass might seize as forfeit after the appointed time     otherwise  heavenborn  mukhum dass would not have lent the money     and now mukhum dass threatens prison     truly  heavenborn   the money lender is without shame  without mercy   without conscience     and that is why you  dog of a spying butler set to betray the sahib s salt you eat  man of smiles and welcome words   stole money from me  was it to pay the debt of thy gambling brat born in a stable     i  heavenborn   i steal from thee   i would rather be beaten     thou shalt be beaten  and worse  thou and thy son   feel in his cummerbund  tom tripe   i saw where the money went    promptly into the butler s sash behind went fingers used to delving into more unmilitary improprieties than any ten civilians could think of   tripe produced the thousand rupee note in less than half a minute and  whether or not he believed it stolen  saw through the plan and laughed    is my name on the back of it   yasmini asked   tom tripe displayed the signature  and chamu s clammy face turned ashen gray    and   said yasmini  fixing chamu with angry blue eyes   the commissioner sahib is on the veranda   for the reputation of the english he would cause an example to be made of servants who steal from guests in the house of foreigners    chamu capitulated utterly  and wept    what shall i do   what shall i do   he demanded    in the jail   yasmini said slowly   you could not spy on my doings  nor report my sayings     heavenborn  i am dumb   only take back the money and i am dumb forever  never seeing or having seen or heard either you or this sahib here   take back the money    but yasmini was not so easily balked of her intention    put his thumb print on it  tom tripe  and see that he writes his name    the trembling chamu was led into a room where an ink pot stood open on a desk  and watched narrowly while he made a thumb mark and scratched a signature   then    take the money and pay thy puppy s debt with it   afterward beat the boy   and see to it   yasmini advised   that mukhum dass gives a receipt  lest he claim the debt a second time    speechless between relief  doubt and resentment chamu hid the banknote in his sash and tried to feign gratitude  a quality omitted from his list of elements when a patient  caste less mother brought him yelling into the world    go    tom tripe made a sign to trotters  who went and lay down  obviously bored  and chamu departed backward  bowing repeatedly with both hands raised to his forehead    and now  your ladyship     take that eater of all that is unnamable    she meant the dog    and return to the palace     your ladyship  it s all my life s worth     tell the maharajah that you have spoken with a certain gunga singh  who said that the princess yasmini is at the house of the commissioner sahib     but it s not true   they ll      let the commissioner sahib deny it then   go     but  missy      do as i say  tom tripe  and when i am maharanee of sialpore you shall have double pay  and a troupe of dancing girls  and a dozen horses   and the title of bahadur  and all the brandy you can drink   the sepoys shall furthermore have modern uniforms  and you shall drill them until they fall down dead   i have promised   go    with a wag of his head that admitted impotence in the face of woman s wiles tom strode out by the back way  followed at a properly respectful distance by his  eater of all that is unnamable    then the princess walked through the parlor to the deeply cushioned window seat  outside which the commissioner sat quite alone with mrs  blaine  trying to pull strings whose existence is not hinted at in blue books  yasmini from earliest infancy possessed an uncanny gift of silence  sometimes even when she laughed       chapter three    no tresspass   there s comfort in the purple creed of rosary and hood  there s promise in the temple gong  and hope  deferred  when evensong foretells a morrow s good  there s rapture in the royal right to lay the daily dole in cash or kind at temple door  since sacrifice must go before the saving of a soul  the priests who plot for power now  though future glory preach  themselves alike the victims fall of law that mesmerizes all   each subject unto each   though all is well if all obey and all have humble heart  nor dare to hold in cursed doubt those gems of truth the church lets out  but where s the apple cart  and where s the sacred fiction gone  and who s to have the blame when any upstart takes a hand and  scorning what the priests have planned  plays harry with the game     give a woman the last word always   but be sure it is a question  which you leave unanswered    he was a beau ideal commissioner   the native newspaper said so when he first came  having painfully selected the phrase from a  dictionary of polite english for public purposes  edited by a college graduate at present in the andamans   true  later it had called him an  overbearing and insane procrastinator    an apostle of absolutism   and  plum of all literary gleanings  since it left so much to the imagination of the native reader    laudator temporis acti    but that the was because he had withdrawn his private subscription prior to suspending the paper sine die under paragraph so and so of the act for dealing with sedition   it could not be held to cancel the correct first judgment  any more than the unmeasured early praise had offset later indiscretion   beau ideal must stand   it was not his first call at the blaines  house  although somehow or other he never contrived to find dick blaine at home   as a bachelor he had no domestic difficulties to pin him down when office work was over for the morning  and  being a man of hardly more than forty  of fine physique  with an astonishing capacity for swift work  he could usual finish in an hour before breakfast what would have kept the routine rank and file of orthodox officials perspiring through the day   that was one reason why he had been sent to sialpore  men in the higher ranks  with a pension due them after certain years of service  dislike being hurried   he was a handsome man  too handsome  some said  with a profile l ike a medallion of mark antony that lost a little of its strength and poise when he looked straight at you   a commissionership was an apparent rise in the world   but sialpore has the name of being a departmental cul de sac  and they had laughed in the clubs about  irish promotion  without exactly naming judge o mally    mrs  o mally came from a cathedral city  where distaste for the conventions is forced at high pressure from early infancy    but there are no such things as political blind alleys to a man who is a judge of indiscretion  provided he has certain other unusual gifts as well   sir roland samson  k  c  s  i   was not at all a disappointed man  nor even a discouraged one   most people were at a disadvantage coming up the path through the blaines  front garden   there was a feeling all the way of being looked down on from the veranda that took ten minutes to recover from in the subsequent warmth of western hospitality   but samson had learned long ago that appearance was all in his favor  and he reenforced it with beautiful buff riding boots that drew attention to firm feet and manly bearing  it did him good to be looked at  and he felt  as a painstaking gentleman should  that the sight did spectators no harm    all alone   he asked  feeling sure that mrs  blaine was pleased to see him  and shifting the chair beside her as he sat down in order to see her face better    husband in the hills as usual   i must choose a sunday next time and find him in    tess smiled   she was used to the remark   he always made it  but always kept away on sundays    there was a party at my house last night  and every one agreed what an acquisition you and your husband are to sialpore   you re so refreshing   quite different to what we re all used to     we re enjoying the novelty too  at least  dick doesn t have much time for enjoyment  but      i suppose he has had vast experience of mining     oh  he knows his profession  and works hard   he ll find gold where there is any   said tess    you never told me how he came to choose sialpore as prospecting ground    tess recognized the prevarication instantly   almost the first thing dick had done after they arrived was to make a full statement of all the circumstances in the commissioner s office   however  she was not her husband   there was no harm in repetition    the maharajah s secretary wrote to a mining college in the states for the name of some one qualified to explore the old workings in these hills  they gave my husband s name among others  and he got in correspondence  finally  being free at the time  we came out here for the trip  and the maharajah offered terms on the spot that we accepted   that is all    samson laughed    i m afraid not all   a contract with the british government would be kept  i won t say a written agreement with gungadhura is worthless  but      oh  he has to pay week by week in advance to cover expenses     very wise   but how about if you find gold     we get a percentage    every word of that  as tess knew  the commissioner could have ascertained in a minute from his office files   so she was quite as much on guard as he  quite as alert to discover hidden drifts    i m afraid there ll be complications   he went on with an air of friendly frankness    perhaps i d better wait until i can see your husband     if you like  of course   but he and i speak the same language   what you tell me will reach him  anything you say  just as you say it     i d better be careful then   he answered  smiling    wise wives don t always tell their husbands everything     i ve no secrets from mine     unusual   he smiled    i might say obsolete   but you americans with your reputation for divorce and originality are very old fashioned in some things  aren t you     what did you want me to tell my husband   countered tess    i wonder if he understands how complicated conditions are here  for instance  does your contract stipulate where the gold is to be found     on the maharajah s territory     anywhere within those limits     so i understand     is the kind of gold mentioned     how many kinds are there    he gained thirty seconds for reflection by lighting a cigar  and decided to change his ground    i know nothing of geology  i m afraid   i wonder if your husband knows about the so called islands   there are patches of british territory  administered directly by us  within the maharajah s boundaries   and little islands of native territory administered by the maharajah s government within the british sphere     something like our indian reservations  i suppose     not exactly  but the analogy will do   if your husband were to find gold   of any kind  on one of our  islands  within the maharajah s territory  his contract with the maharajah would be useless     are the boundaries of the islands clearly marked     not very   they re known  of course  and recorded   there s an old fort on one of them  garrisoned by a handful of british troops  a constant source of heart burn  i believe  to gungadhura   he can see the top of the flag staff from his palace roof   a predecessor of mine had the pole lengthened  i m told   on the other hand  there s a very pretty little palace over on our side of the river with about a half square mile surrounding it that pertains to the native state   your husband could dig there  of course  there s no knowing that it might not pay  if he s looking for more kinds of gold than one    tess contrived not to seem aware that she was being pumped    d you mean that there might be alluvial gold down by the river   she asked    now  now  mrs  blaine   he laughed    you americans are not so ingenuous as you like to seem   do you really expect us to believe that your husband s purpose isn t in fact to discover the sialpore treasure     i never heard of it     i suspect he hasn t told you     i ll bet with you  if you like   she answered    our contract against your job that i know every single detail of his terms with gungadhura     well  well   of course i believe you  mrs  blaine   we re not overheard are we    not forgetful of the princess yasmini hidden somewhere in the house behind her  but unsuspicious yet of that young woman s gift for garnering facts  tess stood up to look through the parlor window   she could see all of the room except the rear part of the window seat  a little more than a foot of which was shut out of her view by the depth of the wall   a cat  for instance  could have lain there tucked among the cushions perfectly invisible    none of the servants is in there   she said  and sat down again  nodding in the direction of a gardener    there s the nearest possible eavesdropper    samson had made up his mind   this was not an occasion to be actually indiscreet  but a good chance to pretend to be   he was a judge of those matters    there have been eighteen rajahs of sialpore in direct succession father to son   he said  swinging a beautiful buff leather boot into view by crossing his knee  and looking at her narrowly with the air of a man who unfolds confidences    the first man began accumulating treasure  every single rajah since has added to it   each man has confided the secret to his successor and to none else  father to son  you understand  when bubru singh  the last man  died he had no son   the secret died with him     how does anybody know that there s a secret then   demanded tess    everybody knows it   the money was raised by taxes   minister after minister in turn has had to hand over minted gold to the reigning rajah      and look the other way  i suppose  while the rajah hid the stuff   suggested tess   samson screwed up his face like a man who has taken medicine    there are dozens of ways in a native state of getting rid of men who know too much     even under british overrule    he nodded   poison  snakes  assassination  jail on trumped up charges  and disease in jail  apparent accidents of all sorts   it doesn t pay to know too much     then we re suspected of hunting for this treasure   is that the idea     not at all  since you ve denied it   i believe you implicitly   but i hope your husband doesn t stumble on it     why     or if he does  that he ll see his way clear to notify me first     would that be honest    he changed his mind   that was a point on which samson prided himself  he was not hidebound to one plan as some men are  but could keep two or three possibilities in mind and follow up whichever suited him  this was a case for indiscretion after all    seeing we re alone  and that you re a most exceptional woman  i think i ll let you into a diplomatic secret  mrs  blaine   only you mustn t repeat it  the present maharajah  gungadhura  isn t the saving kind   he s a spender  he d give his eyes to get hold of that treasure   and if he had it  we d need an army to suppress him   we made a mistake when bubru singh died   there were two nephews with about equal claims  and we picked the wrong one  a born intriguer   i d call him a rascal if he weren t a reigning prince   it s too late now to unseat him  unless  of course  we should happen to catch him in flagrante delicto     what does that mean   with the goods   with the treasure     no  no   in the act of doing something grossly ultra vires  illegal  that s to say   but you ve put your finger on the point   if the treasure should be found  as it might be  somewhere hidden on that little plot of ground with a palace on it on our side of the river  our problem would be fairly easy  there d be some way of  ah  making sure the fund would be properly administered   but if gungadhura found it in the hills  and kept quiet about it as he doubtless would  he d have every sedition monger in india in his pay within a year  and the consequences might be very serious     who is the other man  the one the british didn t choose   asked tess    a very decent chap named utirupa  quite a sportsman   he was thought too young at the time the selection was made   but he knew enough to get out of the reach of the new maharajah immediately   they have a phrase here  you know   to hate like cousins    they re rather remote cousins  but they hate all the more for that     so you d rather that the treasure stayed buried     not exactly   but he tossed ash from the end of his cigar to illustrate offhandedness    i think i could promise ten per cent  of it to whoever brought us exact information of its whereabouts before the maharajah could lay his hands on it     i ll tell that to my husband     do     of course  being in a way in partnership with gungadhura  he might      let me give you one word of caution  if i may without offense   we   our government  wouldn t recognize the right of  of any one to take that treasure out of the country   ten per cent  would be the maximum  and that only in case of accurate information brought in time to us     aren t findings keepings   isn t possession nine points of the law   laughed tess    in certain cases  yes   but not where government knows of the existence somewhere of a hoard of public funds  an enormous hoard  it must run into millions     then  if the maharajah should find it would you take it from him     no   we would put the screws on  and force him to administer the fund properly if we knew about it   but he d never tell     then how d you know he hasn t found the stuff already     because many of his personal bills aren t paid  and the political stormy petrels are not yet heading his way   he s handicapped by not being able to hunt for it openly   some ill chosen confidant might betray the find to us   i doubt if he trusts more than one or two people at a time     it must be hell to be a maharajah   tess burst out after a minute s silence    it s sometimes hell to be commissioner  mrs  blaine     if i were gungadhura i d find that money or bust   and when i d found it      you d endow an orphan asylum  eh     i d make such trouble for you english that you d be glad to leave me in peace for a generation    samson laughed good naturedly and twisted up the end of his mustache    pon my soul  you re a surprising woman   so your sympathies are all with gungadhura     not at all   i think he s a criminal   he buys women  and tortures animals in an arena  and keeps a troupe of what he is pleased to call dancing girls  i ve seen his eyes in the morning  and i suspect him of most of the vices in the calendar   he s despicable   but if i were in his shoes i d find that money and make it hot for you english     are you of irish extraction  mrs  blaine     no  indeed i m not   i m connecticut yankee  and my husband s from the west   i don t have to be irish to think for myself  do i    samson did not know whether or not to take her seriously  but recognized that his chance had gone that morning for the flirtation he had had in view   very mild  of course  for a beginning   it was his experience that most things ought to start quite mildly  if you hoped to keep the other man from stampeding the game   nevertheless  as a judge of situations  be preferred not to take his leave at that moment   give a woman the last word always  but be sure it is a question  which you leave unanswered    you ve a beautiful garden   he said   and for a minute or two they talked of flowers  of which he knew more than a little   then of music  of which he understood a very great deal    have you a proper lease on this house   he asked at last    i believe so  why     i ve been told there s some question about the title   some one s bringing suit against your landlord for possession on some ground or another     what of it   suppose the other should win  could he put us out     i don t know   that might depend on your present landlord s power to make the lease at the time when he made it     but we signed the agreement in good faith   surely  as long as we pay the rent       i don t know  i m sure   well  if there s any trouble  come to me about it and we ll see what can be done     but who is this who is bringing suit against the landlord     i haven t heard his name  don t even know the details   i hope you ll come out of it all right   certainly i ll help in any way i can   sometimes a little influence  you know  exerted in the right way  well  please give my regards to your husband  good morning  mrs  blaine    it was a pet theory of his that few men pay enough attention to their backs   not that he preached it   preaching is tantamount to spilling beans  supposing that the other fellow listens   and if he doesn t listen it is waste of breath   but he bore in mind that people behind him had eyes as well as those in front   accordingly he made a very dignified exit down the long path  tipped mrs  blaine s sais all the man had any right to expect  and rode away feeling that he had made the right impression  he looked particularly well on horseback   theresa blaine smiled after him  wondering what impression she herself had made   but she did not have much time to think about it   from the open window behind her she was seized suddenly  drawn backward and embraced    you are perfect   yasmini purred in her ear between kisses    you are surely one of the fairies sent to live among mortals for a sin   i shall love you forever   now that burra wallah samson sahib will ride into the town  and perhaps also to the law court  and to other places  to ask about your landlord  of whom he knows nothing  having only heard a servant s tale   but tom tripe will have told already that i am at the burra commissioner s house  and gungadhura will send there to ask questions   and whoever goes will have to wait long   and when the commissioner returns at last he will deny that i have been there  and the messenger will return to gungadhura  who will not believe a word of it  especially as he will know that the commissioner has been riding about the town on an unknown errand   so  after he has learned that i am back in my own palace  gungadhura will try to poison me again   all of which is as it should be  come closer and let me      child   tess protested   do you realize that you re dressed up like an extremely handsome man  and are kissing me through a window in the sight of all sialpore   how much reputation do you suppose i shall have left within the hour    there is only one kind of reputation worth the having   laughed yasmini   that of knowing how to win     but what s this about poison   tess asked her    he always tries to poison me   now he will try more carefully     you must take care   how will you prevent him    by quite unconscious stages tess found herself growing concerned about this young truant princess   one minute she was interested and amused   the next she was conscious of affection   now she was positively anxious about her  to use no stronger word   nor had she time to wonder why  for yasmini s methods were breathless    i shall eat very often at your house   and then you shall take a journey with me   and after that the great pig gungadhura shall be very sorry he was born  and still more sorry that be tried to poison me     tell me  child  haven t you a mother     she died a year ago   if there is such a place as hell she has gone there  of course  because nobody is good enough for heaven   but i am not christian and not hindu  so hell is not my business     what are you  then     i am yasmini   there is nobody like me   i am all alone  believing only what i know and laughing at the priests   i know all the laws of caste  because that is necessary if you are to understand men   and i have let the priests teach me their religion because it is by religion that they govern people   and the priests   she laughed   are much more foolish than the fools they entice and frighten   but the priests have power  gungadhura is fearfully afraid of them   the high priest of the temple of jinendra pretends to him that he can discover where the treasure is hidden  so gungadhura makes daily offerings and the priest grows very fat     who taught you such good english   tess asked her   for there was hardly even a trace of foreign accent  nor the least hesitation for a word    father bernard  a jesuit   my mother sent for him  and he came every day  year after year   he had a little chapel in sialpore where a few of the very low caste people used to go to pray and make confessions to him   that should have given him great power   but the people of this land never confess completely  as he told me the europeans do  preferring to tell lies about one another rather than the truth about themselves  i refused to be baptized because i was tired of him  and after my mother died and she was burned with the hindu ritual  he received orders to go elsewhere   now there is another jesuit  but he only has a little following among the english  and can not get to see me because i hide behind the purdah   the purdah is good  if you know how to make use of it and not be ruled by it    they were still in the window  yasmini kneeling on the cushions with her face in shadow and tess with her back to the light    ah   hasamurti comes   said yasmini suddenly    she is my cheti    hand maiden    tess turned swiftly  but all she saw was one of the three beggars down by the little gate twisting himself a garland out of stolen flowers    now there will be a carriage waiting  and i must leave my horse in your stable    the beggar held the twisted flowers up to the sun light to admire his work    i must go at once   i shall go to the temple of jinendra  where the priest  who is no man s friend  imagines i am a friend of his   he will promise me anything if i will tell him what to say to gungadhura   and i shall tell him  without believing the promises   one of these days perhaps he will plot with gungadhura to have me poisoned  being in agreement with the commissioner sahib who said to you just now that it is not good to know too much   but neither is it good to be too late   lend me a covering  my sister  see  this is the very thing   i shall leave by the little gate  send the gardener on an errand   are the other servants at the back of the house   of course yes  they will be spying to see me leave by the way i came    tess sent the gardener running for a basket to put flowers in  and when she turned her head again yasmini had stepped out through the window shrouded from head to heels in a camel hair robe such as the bikanir desert men wear at night   the lower part of her face was hooded in it   provided you wear a turban you can wear anything else you like in india without looking incongruous   it is the turban that turns the trick   even the spurs on the heels of riding boots did not look out of place    you ll sweat   laughed tess    that camel hair is hot stuff     does the panther sweat under his pelt   i am stronger than a panther  now swiftly   i must go  but i will come soon   you are my friend    she was gone like a shadow without another word  with long swift strides  not noticing the beggars and not noticed by them as far as any one could tell  tess sat down to smoke a cigarette and think the experience over   she had not done thinking when dick blaine returned unexpectedly for early lunch and showed her a bag full of coarsely powdered quartz    there s color there   he said jubilantly    rather more than merely color  it s not time to talk yet  but i think i ve found a vein that may lead somewhere  then won t gungadhura gloat    she told him at great length about yasmini s visit  dwelling on every detail of it  he listening like a man at a play  for tess had the gift of clear description    go a journey with her  if you feel like it  tess   he advised    you have a rotten time here alone all day  and i can t do much to  liven it   take sensible precautions but have a good time anyway you can    because yasmini had monopolized imagination she told him last of all  at lunch  about the commissioner s call  rehearsing that  too  detail by detail  word for word    wants me to find the treasure  does he  and call the game on gungadhura  what does he take me for   one of his stool pigeons   if it s a question of percentage  i d prefer one from the maharajah than from him   if i ever stumble on it  gungadhura shall know first go off the bat  and i ll see the british government in hell before i ll answer questions     they d never believe gungadhura hadn t rewarded you   said tess    what of it   he demanded    what do we care what they believe   and supposing it were true  what then   just at present i m in partnership with gungadhura        chapter four   jinendra s smile  deep broods the calm where the cooing doves are mating and shadows quiver noiseless  neath the courtyard trees  cool keeps the gloom where the suppliants are waiting begging little favors of jinendra on their knees  peace over all  and the consciousness of nearness  charity removing the remoteness of the gods  spirit of compassion breathing with new clearness  there s a limit set to khama   there s a surcease from the rods    blessed were the few  who trim the lights of kindness  toiling in the temple for the love of one and all  if it were not for hypocrisy and gluttony and blindness   smiles the image of jinendra on the courtyard wall     the law      is like a python after monkey s in the tree tops    yasmini  hooded like a bandit in the camel hair cloak  resumed an air of leisurely dignity in keeping with the unhurried habit of sialpore the moment she was through the gate   it was just as well she did  for mukhum dass  the money lender  followed by a sweating lean parasite on foot  was riding a smart mule on his customary morning round to collect interest from victims and oversee securities   he was a fat  squat  slimy looking person in a black alpaca coat  with a black umbrella for protection from the sun  and an air of sour dissatisfaction for general business purposes  an air that was given the lie direct by a small  acquisitive nose and bright brown eyes that surely never made bad bargains    yasmini s hooded figure brought him to a halt just at the corner  where the little road below the blaines  wall joined the wider road that led down hill   business is business  and time a serious matter only for those who sign promissory notes   he drew rein without compunction    this house is yours   she asked  and he nodded  his sharp eyes shining like an animal s  determined to recognize his questioner    there is a miscalculating son of lies who brings a lawsuit to get the title    he nodded again  a man of few words except when words exacted interest    dhulap singh  is it not   he is a secret agent of gungadhura     how do you know   why should the maharajah want my property     he hunts high and low for the sialpore treasure   jengal singh  who built this house  was in the confidence of gungadhura s uncle  and a priest says there will be a clue found to the treasure beneath the floor of this house     a likely tale indeed     very well  then  lose thine house    yasmini turned on a disdainful heel and started down hill   mukhum dass called after her  but she took no notice  he sent the sweating parasite to bring her back  but she shook him off with execrations  mukhum dass turned his mule and rode down hill after her    true information has its price   he said    tell me your name     that also has its price    he cackled dryly    natives cost money only to their owners  on a hundi    promissory note     nevertheless there is a price     in advance   i will give a half rupee    once more yasmini resumed her way down hill   again mukhum dass rode after her    at any rate name the price     it is silence firstly   second  a security for silence     the first part is easy     nay  difficult   a woman can keep silence  but men chatter like the apes  in every coffee shop    his bargain driver s eyes watched hers intently  unable to detect the slightest clue that should start him guessing   he was trying to identify a man  not a woman    how shall i give security for silence   he asked    i already hold it     how   what   where    the money lender betrayed a glimpse of sheer pugnacity that seemed to amuse his tormentor    send thy jackal out of ear shot  tiger    he snapped at his parasite angrily  and the man went away to sit down   then    where are the title deeds of the house you say you own   she asked him suddenly   mukhum dass kept silence  and tried to smother the raging anger in his eyes    was it mukhum dass or another  who went to the priest in the temple of jinendra on a certain afternoon and requested intercession to the god in order that a title deed might be recovered  that fell down the nullah when the snakes frightened a man s mule and he himself fell into the road   or was it another accident that split that car of thine in two pieces     priests cackle like old women   growled the money lender    nay  but this one cackled to the god   perhaps jinendra felt compassionate toward a poor shroff  money lender  who can not defend his suit successfully without that title deed   jengal singh died and his son  who ought to know  claims that the house was really sold to dhulap singh  who dallies with his suit because he suspects  but does not know  that mukhum dass has lost the paper  eh     how do you know these things     maybe the god jinendra told   which would be better  mukhum dass   to keep great silence  and be certain to receive the paper in time to defend the lawsuit   or to talk freely  and so set others talking    who knows that it might not reach the ears of jengal singh that the title deed is truly lost     he who tells secrets to a priest   swore the money lender   would better have screamed them from the housetop    nay  the god heard   the priest told the god  and the god told a certain one to whom the finder brought the paper  asking a reward   that person holds the paper now as security for silence     it is against the law to keep my paper     the law catches whom it can  mukhum dass  letting all others go  like a python after monkeys in the tree tops     from whom am i to get my paper for the lawsuit at the proper time     from jinendra s priest perhaps     he has it now   the dog s stray offspring   i will      nay  he has it not   be kind and courteous to jinendra s priest  or perhaps the god will send the paper after all to dhulap singh     as to what shall i keep silence     two matters   firstly chamu the butler will presently pay his son s debt  give chamu a receipt with the number of the bank note written on it  saying nothing     second     preserve the bank note carefully for thirty days and keep silence     i will do that   now tell me thy name    yasmini laughed    do thy victims repay in advance the rupees not yet lent   nay  the price is silence   first  pay the price   then learn my name  go  get thy money from chamu the butler   breathe as much as a hint to any one  and thy title deed shall go to dhulap singh    eying her like a hawk  but with more mixed emotions than that bird can likely compass  the money lender sat his mule and watched her stride round the corner out of sight   then  glancing over her shoulder to make sure the man s parasite was not watching her at his master s orders  she ran along the shoulder of the hill to where  in the shelter of a clump of trees  a carriage waited   it was one of those lumbering  four wheeled affairs with four horses  and a platform for two standing attendants behind and wooden lattice work over the windows  in which the women folk of princes take the air  but there were no attendants  only a coachman  and a woman who came running out to meet her   for yasmini  like her cousin the maharajah  did not trust too many people all at once    quick  hasamurti    fussing and giggling over her  the very name means laughter   the maid bustled her into the carriage  and without a word of instruction the coachman tooled his team down hill at a leisurely gait  as if told in advance to take his time about it   the team was capable of speed   inside the carriage  with a lot more chuckling and giggling a change was taking place almost as complete as that from chrysalis to butterfly  the toilet of a lady of yasmini s nice discrimination takes time in the easiest circumstances   in a lumbering coach  not built for leg room  and with a looking glass the size of a saucer  it was a mixture of horse play and miracle   between them they upset the perfume bottle  as was natural  and a shrill scream at one stage of the journey  that started a rumor all over sialpore to the effect that gungadhura was up to the same old game again  announced  as a matter of plain fact that yasmini had sat on the spurs   there was long  spun gold hair to be combed out  penciling to do to eye brows  lac to be applied to pretty feet to make them exquisitely pretty  and layer on layer of gossamer silk to be smothered and hung exactly right   then over it all had to go one of those bright hued silken veils that look so casually worn but whose proper adjustment is an art   but when they reached the bottom of the long hill and began twisting in and out among the narrow streets  it was finished   by the time they reached the temple of jinendra  set back in an old stone courtyard with images of the placid god carved all about in the shade of the wide projecting cornice  all was quiet and orderly inside the carriage and there stepped out of it  followed by the same dark hooded maid  a swift vision of female loveliness that flitted like a flash of light into the temple gloom   it was not so squalid as the usual hindu temple  although so ancient that the carving of the pillars in some places was almost worn away  and the broad stone flags on the floor were hollowed deep by ages of devotion   the gloom was pierced here and there by dim light from brass lamps  that showed carvings blackened by centuries of smoke  but there was an unlooked for suggestion of care  and a little cleanliness that the fresh blossoms scattered here and there accentuated   there were very few worshipers at that hour  only a woman  who desired a child and was praying to jinendra as a last recourse after trying all the other gods in vain  and a half dozen men  all eyes  who gossiped in low tones in a corner   yasmini gave them small chance to recognize her   quicker than their gaze could follow  a low door at the rear  close beside the enormous  jeweled image of the god  closed behind her and the maid  and all that was left of the vision was the ringing echo of an iron lock dying away in dark corners and suggesting nothing except secrecy   the good square room she had entered so abruptly unannounced was swept and washed   sunlight poured into it at one end through a window that opened on an inner courtyard  and there were flowers everywhere   arranged in an enormous brass bowl on a little table  scattered at random on the floor  hung in plaited garlands from the hooks intended to support lamps   of furniture there was little  only a long cushioned bench down the length of the wall beneath the window  and a thing like a throne on which jinendra s high priest sat in solitary grandeur   he did not rise at first to greet her  for jinendra s priest was fat   there was no gainsaying it   after about a minute a sort of earthquake taking place in him began to reach the surface   he rocked on his center in increasing waves that finally brought him with a spasm of convulsion to the floor   there he stood in full sunlight with his bare toes turned inward  holding his stomach with both hands  while yasmini settled herself in graceful youthful curves on the cushioned bench  with her face in shadow  and the smirking maid at her feet   then before climbing ponderously back to his perch on the throne the priest touched his forehead once with both hands and came close to a semblance of bowing  the arrogance of sanctity combining with his paunch to cut that ceremony short    send the girl away   he suggested as soon as he was settled into place again   but yasmini laughed at him with that golden note of hers that suggests illimitable understanding and unfathomable mirth    i know the ways of priests   she answered    the girl stays    the priest s fat chops darkened a shade    there are things she should not know     she knows already more in her small head than there is in all thy big belly  priest of an idol     beware  woman  lest the gods hear sacrilege     if they are real gods they love me   she answered    if they have any sense they will be pleased whenever i laugh at your idolatry   hasamurti stays     but at the first imaginary insult she will run with information to wherever it will do most harm   if she can be made properly afraid  perhaps     yasmini s golden laugh cut him off short    if she is made afraid now she will hate me later   as long as she loves me she will keep my secrets  and she will love me because of the secrets  being a woman and not a belly with a big tongue  who would sell me to the highest bidder  if he dared   i know a brahman   thou and i are co conspirators because my woman s wit is sharper than thy greed   we are confidants because i know too much of thy misdeeds  we are going to succeed because i laugh at thy fat fears  and am never deceived for a moment by pretense of sanctity or promises however vehement    she said all that in a low sweet voice  and with a smile that would have made a much less passionate man lose something of his self command  jinendra s priest began to move uneasily    peace  woman     there is no peace where priests are   she retorted in the same sweet  humored voice    i am engaged in war  not honey gathering   i have lied sufficient times today to mukhum dass to need ten priests  if i believed in them or were afraid to lie   the shroff will come to ask about his title deed   tell him you are told a certain person has it  but that if he dares breathe a word the paper will go straight to dhulap singh  who will destroy it and so safely bring his lawsuit   then let dhulap singh be told also that the title deed is in certain hands  so he will put off the lawsuit week after week  and one who is my friend will suffer no annoyance     who is this friend     another one who builds no bridges on thy sanctity     not one of the english   beware of them  i say   beware of them     no  not one of the english   next  let gungadhura be told that tom tripe has ever an open handed welcome at blaine sahib s      ah   he objected  shaking his fat face until the cheeks wabbled   women are all fools sooner or later   why let a drunken english soldier be included in the long list of people to be reckoned with     because gungadhura will then show much favor to tom tripe  who is my friend  and it amuses me to see my friends prosper   also i have a plan     plans  plans  plans   and whither does the tangle lead us     to the treasure  fool     but if you know so surely where the treasure is  woman  why not tell me and      again the single note of mocking golden laughter cut him off short    i would trust thee with the secret  brahman  just as far as the herdsman trusts a tiger with his sheep     but i could insure that gungadhura should divide it into three parts  and      when the time comes   she answered   the priest of jinendra shall come to me for his proportion  not i to the priest   nor will there be three portions  but one  with a little percentage taken from it for the sake of thy fat belly   gungadhura shall get nothing     i wash my hands of it all   the priest retorted indignantly    the half for me  or i wash my hands of it and tell gungadhura that you know the secret   i will trust him to find a way to draw thy cobra from its hole     maybe he might   she nodded  smiling   after the english had finished hanging thee for that matter of the strangling of rum dass   thy fat belly would look laughable indeed banging by a stretched neck from a noose  they would need a thick rope   they might even make the knot slippery with cow grease for thy special benefit    the priest winced    none can prove that matter   he said  recovering his composure with an effort    except i   she retorted   who have the very letter that was written to rum dass that brought him into thy clutches  and five other proofs beside  two long years i waited to have a hold on thee  priest  before i came to blossom in the odor of thy sanctity   now i am willing to take the small chance of thy temper getting the better of discretion     you are a devil   he said simply  profoundly convinced of the truth of his remark   and she laughed like a mischievous child  clapping her hands together    so now   she said   there is little else to discuss   if gungadhura should be superstitious fool enough to come to thee again for auguries and godly counsel      he comes always   he shows proper devotion to jinendra     repeat the former story that a clue to the treasure must be found in blaine sahib s house       in what form   he will ask me again in what form the clue will be  that he may recognize it     tell him there is a map   and be sure to tell him that tom tripe is welcome at the house   have you understood   then one other matter  when it is known that i am back in my palace gungadhura will set extra spies on me  and will double the guard at all the doors to keep me from getting out again   he will not trust tom tripe this time  but will give the charge to one of the rajput officers   but he will have been told that i was at the commissioner sahib s house this morning  and therefore he will not dare to have me strangled  because the commissioner sahib might make inquiries   i have also made other precautions  and a friend   but tell gungadhura  lest he make altogether too much trouble for me  that i applied to the commissioner sahib for assistance to go to europe  saying i am weary of india   and add that the commissioner sahib counseled me not to go  but promised to send english memsahibs to see me     she very nearly used the word american  but thought better of it on the instant     he will ask me how i know this   said the brahman  turning it all over slowly in his mind and trying to make head or tail of it    tell him i came here like himself for priestly counsel and made a clean breast of everything to thee   he will suspect thee of lying to him   but what is one lie more or less    with that final shaft she gathered up her skirts  covered her face  nudged the giggling maid and left him  turning the key in the lock herself and flitting out through gloom into the sunlight as fast as she had come  the carriage was still waiting at the edge of the outer court  and once again the driver started off without instructions  but tooling his team this time at a faster pace  with a great deal of whip cracking and shouts to pedestrians to clear the way   and this time the carriage had an escort of indubitable maharajah s men  who closed in on it from all sides  their numbers increasing  mounted and unmounted  until by the time yasmini s own palace gate was reached there was as good as a state procession  made up for the most part of men who tried to look as if they had made a capture by sheer derring do and skill   and down the street  helter skelter on a sweating thoroughbred  came maharajah gungadhura singh just in time to see the back of the carriage as it rumbled in through the gateway and the iron doors clanged behind it  scowling  altogether too round shouldered for the martial stock he sprang from  puffy eyed  and not so regal as overbearing in appearance  he sat for a few minutes stroking his scented beard upward and muttering to himself   then some one ventured to tell him where the carriage had been seen waiting  and with what abundant skill it had been watched and tracked from jinendra s temple to that gate   at that he gave an order about the posting of the guard  and  beckoning only one mounted attendant to follow him  clattered away down street  taking a turn or two to throw the curious off the scent  and then headed straight for the temple on his own account       chapter five     an audit by the gods   i   thus spoke the gods from their place above the firmament turning from the feasting and the music and the mirth   there is time and tide to burn  let us stack the plates a turn and study at our leisure what the trouble is with earth    down  down they looked through the azure of the infinite scanning each the meadows where he went with men of yore  each his elbows on a cloud  making reckoning aloud   till the murmur of god wonder was a titan thunder roar    war rocks the world   look  the arquebus and culverin vanish in new sciences that presage t  n  t  lo  a dark  discolored swath where they drive new tools of wrath  do they justify invention   will they scrap the laws that be    look   mark ye well   where we left a people flourishing singing in the sunshine for the fun of being free  now they burden man and maid with a law the priests have laid  and the bourgeois blow their noses by a communal decree    where  where away are the liberties we left to them   gift of being merry and the privilege of fun  is delight no longer praise  will they famish all their days for a future built of fury in a present scarce begun      most precious friend     please visit me    the one thing in india that never happens is the expected   if the actual thing itself does occur  then the manner of it sets up so many unforeseen contingencies that only the subtlest mind  and the sanest and the least hidebound by opinion  can hope to read the signs fast enough to understand them as they happen   naturally  there are always plenty of people who can read backward after the event   and the few of those who keep the lesson to themselves  digesting rather than discussing it  are to be found eventually filling the senior secretaryships  albeit bitterly criticized by the other men  who unraveled everything afterward very cleverly and are always unanimous on just one point  that the fellow who said nothing certainly knew nothing  and is therefore of no account and should wield no influence  q  e  d   and as we belong to the majority  in that we are uncovering the course of these events very cleverly long after they took place  we must at this point  to be logical  denounce theresa blaine   she was just as much puzzled as anybody   but she said much less than anybody  wasted no time at all on guesswork  pondered in her heart persistently whatever she had actually seen and heard  and in the end was almost the only non indian actor on the stage of sialpore to reap advantage  if that does not prove unfitness for one of the leading parts  what does  a star should scintillate  should focus all eyes on herself and interrupt the progress of the play to let us know how wise and beautiful and wonderful she is   but tess apparently agreed with hamlet that  the play s the thing   and was much too interested in the plot to interfere with it   she attended the usual round of dinners  teas and tennis parties  that are part of the system by which the english keep alive their courage  and growing after a while a little tired of trivialty  she tried to scandalize sialpore by inviting tom tripe to her own garden party  successfully overruling tripe s objections    between you and i and the gate post  lady  they don t hanker for my society   if somebody  especially colonels  or a judge maybe   wanted to borrow a horse from the maharajah s stable   or perhaps they d like a file o  men to escort a picnic in the hills   then it s  oh  hello  good morning  mr  tripe   how s the dog this morning   and oh  by the way    then i know what s coming an  what i can do for  em i do  for i confess  lady  that i hanker for a little bit o  flattery and a few words o  praise i m not entitled to   i don t covet any man s money  or at least not enough to damn me into hell on that account   finding s keeping  and a bet s a bet  but i don t covet money more than that dog o  mine covets fleas  he likes to scratch  em when he has  em   me the same   i can use money with the next man  his or mine   but i wouldn t go to hell for money any more than trotters would for fleas  although  mind you  i m not saying trotters hasn t got fleas   he has  em  same as hell s most folks  destiny  but when it comes to praise that ain t due me  lady  i m like trotters with another dog s bone  i ve simply got to have it  reason or no reason  a common ordinary bone with meat on it is just a meal   praise i ve earned is nothing wonderful   but praise i don t deserve is stolen fruit  and that s the sweetest   now  if i was to come to your party i d get no  praise  ma am   i d be doing right by you  but they d say i didn t know my place  and by and by they d prove it to me sharp and sneery   i ll be a coward to stop away  but   sensible man   they ll say    knows when he isn t wanted    you see  ma am  yours is the only house in sialpore where i can walk in and know i m welcome whether you re at home or not     all the more reason for coming to the party  tom     ah h h   if only you understood    he wagged his head and one finger at her in his half amused paternal manner that would often win for him when all else failed   but this time it did not work    i don t care for half friends  tom   if you expect to be welcome at my house you must come to my parties when i ask you     lady  lady     i mean it     oh  very well   i ll come   i ve protested   that absolves me   and my hide s thick   it takes more than just a snub or two  or three to knock my number down   am i to bring trotters     certainly   trotters is my friend too   i count on him to do his tricks and help entertain     they ll say of you  ma am  afterward that you don t know better than ask tripe and his vulgar dog to meet nice people     they ll be right  tom   i don t know better   i hope they ll say it to me  that s all    but tess discovered when the day came that no american can scandalize the english   they simply don t expect an american to know bow to behave  and tom tripe and his marvelous performing dog were accepted and approved of as sincerely as the real american ice cream soda   and forgotten as swiftly the morning following   the commissioner was actually glad to meet tripe in the circumstances  if the man should suppose that because sir roland samson and a judge of appeal engaged in a three cornered conversation with him at a garden party  therefore either of them would speak to the maharajah s drill master when next they should meet in public  he might guess again  that was all   one of the things the commissioner asked tripe was whether he was responsible for the mounting of palace guards  of course not improperly inquisitive about the maharajah s personal affairs but anxious to seem interested in the fellow s daily round  since just then one couldn t avoid him    in a manner  and after a fashion  yes  sir   i m responsible that routine goes on regularly and that the men on duty know their business     ah   nothing like responsibility   good for a man   some try to avoid it  but it s good   so you look after the guard on all the palaces   the princess yasmini s too  eh   well  well   i can imagine that might be nervous work   they say that young lady is     eh  tripe     i couldn t say  sir   my duties don t take me inside the palace     now  now  tripe   no use trying to look innocent   they tell me she s a handful and you encourage her     some folks don t care what they say  sir     if she should be in trouble i dare say  now  you d be the man she d apply to for help     i d like to think that  sir     might ask you to take a letter for instance  to me or his honor the judge here    the judge walked away   he did not care to be mixed up in intrigue  even hypothetically  and especially with a member of the lower orders    i d do for her what i d do for a daughter of my own  sir  neither more nor less     quite so  tripe   if she gave you a letter to bring to me  you d bring it  eh     excepting barratry  the ten commandments  earthquake and the act of god  sir  yes     without the maharajah knowing     without his highness knowing     you d do that with a clear conscience  eh    tom tripe screwed his face up  puffed his cheeks  and struck a very military attitude    a soldier s got no business with a conscience  sir   conscience makes a man squeamish o  doing right for fear his wife s second cousin might tell the neighbors     ha ha   very profoundly philosophic   i dare wager you ve carried her letters at least a dozen times  now come    again tom tripe puffed out his cheeks and struck an attitude    men don t get hanged for murder  sir     for what  then     talking before and afterward     excellent   if only every one remembered that   did it ever occur to you how the problem might be reversed      sir     there might one day be a letter for the princess yasmini that  as her friend  you ought to make sure should reach her     i d take a letter from you to her  sir  if that s your meaning    sir roland samson  k  c  s  i   looked properly shocked   there are few things so appalling as the abruptness with which members of the lower orders divest diplomacy s kernel of its decorative outer shell   what i meant is  ah     he set his monocle  and stared as if tripe were an insect on a pin point    since you admit you re in the business of intriguing for the princess  no doubt you carry letters to  as well as from her  and hold your tongue about that too     if i should deliver letters they d be secret or they d have gone through the mail   i d risk my job each time i did it   would i risk it worse by talking  once the maharajah heard a whisper      well  i ll be careful not to drop a hint to his highness   as you say  it might imperil your job   and  ah     again the monocle      the initials r  s    in small letters  not capitals  in the bottom left hand corner of a small white envelope would  ah  you understand   you d see that she received it  eh    tom tripe bridled visibly   neither the implied threat nor the proposal to make use of him without acknowledging the service afterward  escaped him   samson  who believed among other things in keeping all inferiors thoroughly in their place decided on the instant to rub home the lesson while it smarted    you d find it profitable   you d be paid whatever the situation called for  you needn t doubt that    tess  talking with a group of guests some little distance off  observed a look of battle in tom tripe s eye  and smiled two seconds later as the commissioner let fall his monocle   two things she was certain of at once   tom tripe would tell her at the first opportunity exactly what had happened  and samson would lie about it glibly if provoked   she promised herself she would provoke him   as a matter of fact tom gave her two or three versions afterward of what his words had been  their grandeur increasing as imagination flourished in the comfortable warmth of confidence   but the first account came from a fresh memory    no money you ll ever touch would buy my dog s silence  let alone mine  sir   if you ve a letter for the princess  send it along and i ll see she gets it   if she cares to answer it  i ll see the answer reaches you  as for dropping hints to the maharajah about my doing little services for the princess   a gentleman s a gentleman  and don t need instruction   nor advice from me   if i was out of a job tomorrow i d still be a man on two feet  to be met as such    a man of indiscretion  and a diplomat  must have fireproof feelings  as tess had observed  samson blenched distinctly  but he recovered in a second and put in practise some of that opportunism that was his secret pride  reflecting how a less finished diplomatist would have betrayed resentment at the snub from an inferior instead of affecting not to notice it at all   as a student of human nature he decided that tom tripe s pride was the point to take advantage of    you re the very man i can trust   he said    i m glad we have had this talk  if ever you receive a small white envelope marked r  s  in the left hand bottom corner  see that the princess gets it  and say nothing     trust me  eh   tripe muttered as samson walked away    you never trusted your own mother without you had a secret hold over her   i wouldn t trust you that far    he spat among the flowers  for tom could not pretend to real garden party manners    and if she trusts you  letters or no letters  i ll eat my spurs and saber cold for breakfast    then  as if to console himself with proof that some one in the world did trust him thoroughly  tom swaggered with a riding master stride to where tess stood talking with a rajput prince  who had come late and threatened to leave early   the prince had puzzled her by referring two or three times to his hurry  once even going so far as to say good by  and then not going   it was as if he expected her to know something that she did not know  and to give him a cue that he waited for in vain   she felt he must think her stupid  and the thought made her every minute less at ease   but tom s approach  eyed narrowly by samson for some reason  seemed to raise the rajput s spirits    if only my husband were here   she said aloud   but at the last minute   there was blasting  you know  and     the prince  he was quite a young one  twenty one perhaps  murmured something polite and with eyes that smoldered watched tom take a letter from his tunic pocket   he handed it to tess with quite a flourish    some one must have dropped this  ma am    the envelope was scented  and addressed in persian characters   she saw the prince s eyes devour the thing  saw him exchange glances with tom tripe  and realized that tom had rather deftly introduced her to another actor in the unseen drama that was going on   clearly the next move was hers    is it yours  perhaps   she asked   prince utirupa singh bowed and took the letter   samson with a look of baffled fury behind the monocle  but a smile for appearance s sake  joined them at that minute and utirupa seemed to take delight in so manipulating the sealed envelope that the commissioner could only see the back of it   the prince was an extremely handsome young man  as striking in one way as samson in another   polo and pig sticking had kept him lean  and association with british officers had given him an air of being frankly at his ease even when really very far from feeling it   he had the natural oriental gift of smothering excitement  added to a trick learned from the west of aggressive self restraint that is not satisfied with seeming the opposite of what one is  but insists on extracting humor from the situation and on calling attention to the humor    i shall always be grateful to you   he said  smiling into tess s eyes with his own wonderful brown ones but talking at the commissioner    if i had lost this letter i should have been at a loss indeed   if some one else had found it  that might have been disastrous     but i did not find it for you   tess objected   utirupa turned his back to the commissioner and answered in a low voice    nevertheless  when i lose letters i shall come here first    he bowed to take his leave and showed the back of the envelope again to samson  with a quiet malice worthy of torquemada   the commissioner looked almost capable of snatching it    mrs  blaine   he said with a laugh after the prince had gone   skill and experience  i am afraid  are not much good without luck   luck seems to be a thing i lack   now  if i had picked up that letter i ve a notion that the information in it would have saved me a year s work    tess was quite sure that tom had not picked the letter up  but there was no need to betray her knowledge    do you mean you d have opened a letter you picked up in my garden   she demanded   his eyes accepted her challenge    why not     but why   surely      necessity  dear lady  knows no law   that s one of the first axioms of diplomacy   consider your husband as a case in point   custom  which is the basis of nearly all law  says he ought to be here entertaining your guests   necessity  ignoring custom  obliges him to stay in the hills and supervise the blasting  disappointing every one but me   i m going to take advantage of his necessity    if he had seen the swift glance she gave him he might have changed the course of one small part of history   tess knew nothing of the intrigue he was engaged in  and did not propose to be keeper of his secrets  if he had glimpsed that swift betrayal of her feelings he would certainly not have volunteered further confidences   but the poison of ambition blinds all those who drink it  so that the  safest  men unburden themselves to the wrong unwilling ears    walk with me up and down the path where every one can see us  won t you     why   she laughed    do you flatter yourself i d be afraid to be caught alone with you     i hope you d like to be alone with me   i would like nothing better   but if we walk up and down together on the path in full view  we arouse no suspicion and we can t be overheard   i propose to tell some secrets    not many women would resist the temptation of inside political information  recognizing that by some means beyond her comprehension she was being drawn into a maze of secrets all interrelated and any of them likely to involve herself at any minute  tess had no compunction whatever    i ll be frank with you   she said    i m curious    once they walked up the path and down again  talking of dogs  because it happened that tom tripe s enormous beast was sprawling in the shadow of a rose bush at the farther end   the commissioner did not like dogs    something loathsome about them  degrading  especially the big ones    she disagreed   she liked them  cold wet noses and all  even in the dark   tom tripe  stepping behind a bush with the obvious purpose of smoking in secret the clay pipe that be hardly troubled to conceal  whistled the dog  who leapt into life as if stung and joined his master   the second time up and down they talked of professional beggars and what a problem they are to india  because they both happened as they turned to catch sight of umra with the one eye  entering through the little gate in the wall and shuffling without modesty or a moment s hesitation to his favorite seat among the shrubs  whence to view proceedings undisturbed    those three beggars that haunt this house seem to claim all our privileges   she said    they wouldn t think of letting us give a garden party without them     say the word   he said   and i ll have them put in prison    but she did not say the word   the third time up the path he chose to waste on very obvious flattery    you re such an unusual woman  you know  mrs  blaine   you understand whatever s said to you  and don t ask idiotic questions   and then  of course  you re american  and i feel i can say things to you that my own countrywoman wouldn t understand   as an american  in other words  you re privileged    as they turned at the top of the path she felt a cold wet something thrust into her hand from behind   she had never in her life refused a caress to a dog that asked for one  and her fingers closed almost unconsciously on trotters  muzzle  touching as they did so the square unmistakable hard edges of an envelope   there was no mistaking the intent   the dog forced it on her and  the instant her fingers closed on it  slunk out of sight    wasn t that tripe s infernal dog again     was it   i didn t see   she was wiping slobber on to her skirt from an envelope whose strong perfume had excited the dog s salivary glands  but it was true that she did not see    may i call you theresa     why     it would encourage confidences   there isn t another woman in sialpore whom i could tell what i m going to say to you   the others would repeat it to their husbands  or      i tell mine everything   every word     or they d try to work me on the strength of it for little favors      wait until you know me   little favors don t appeal to me   i like them big  very big     honestly  theresa      better call me mrs  blaine     honestly  there s nothing under heaven that      that you really know about me   i know there isn t   you were going to tell secrets   i m listening     you re a hard hearted woman    she had contrived by that time to extract a letter from the envelope behind her back  but how to read it without informing samson was another matter   as she turned up the path for the sixth time  the sight of tom tripe making semi surreptitious signals to attract her attention convinced her that the message was urgent and that she should not wait to read it until after her last guests were gone   it was only one sheet of paper  written probably on only one side  she hoped in english  but how    suddenly she screamed  and samson was all instant concern    was that a snake   tell me  was that a snake i saw   oh  do look  please  i loathe them     probably a lizard     no  no  i know a lizard   do please look    unbelieving  he took a stick and poked about among the  flowers to oblige her  so she read the message at her leisure behind the broad of his back  and had folded it out of sight before he looked up    no snakes   nothing but a lizard     oh  i m so glad   please forgive me  but i dread snakes   now tell me the secrets while i listen properly    he noticed a change in her voice  symptoms of new interest  and passed it to the credit of himself    there s an intrigue going on  and you can help me   sp  people whose business it is to keep me informed have reported that tom tripe is constantly carrying letters from the princess yasmini of sialpore to that young prince utirupa who was here this afternoon   now  it s no secret that if gungadhura singh were to get found out committing treason  and i m pretty sure he s guilty of it five days out of six   we d depose him      you mean the british would depose him     depose him root and branch   then utirtipa would be next in line  he s a decent fellow   he d be sure of the nomination  and he d make a good ruler     well     i want to know what the princess yasmini has to do with it     it seems to me you re not telling secrets  but asking favors for nothing     not for nothing  not for nothing   there s positively nothing that i won t do     in return for       sure information as to what is going on     which you think i can get for you     i m positive   you re such an extraordinary  woman   i m pretty sure it all hinges on the treasure i told you about the other day   whoever gets first hold of that holds all the trumps   i d like to get it myself   that would be the making of me  politically speaking   if gungadhura should get it he d ruin himself with intrigue in less than a year  but he might cause my ruin in the process   if the local priests should get it  and that s likeliest  all things considered  there d be red ruin for miles around   money and the church don t mix without blood letting  and you can t unscramble that omelet forever afterward   i confess i don t know how to checkmate the priests   gungadhura i think i can manage  especially with your aid  but i must have information     is there any one else who d be dangerous if he possessed the secret     anybody would be  except myself   anybody else would begin playing for political control with it  and there d be no more peace on this side of india for years   and now  this is what i want to say   the most dangerous individual who could possibly get that treasure would be the princess yasmini   the difficulty of dealing with her is that she s not above hiding behind purdah  the veil   where no male man can reach her   there are several women here whom i might interest in keeping an eye on her   tatum s wife  and miss bent  and miss o hara  and the goole sisters   lots of  em   but they d all talk   and they d all try to get influence for their male connections on the strength of being in the know   but somehow  theresa  you re different     mrs  blaine  please     i know tom tripe thinks the world of you   i want you to

his pocket book   behind his back tess waved her secret letter to attract tom tripe s notice  and nodded    there   said samson    that s preliminary   i ll confirm it later by letter on official

success could be complete without      without a whisky and soda   come and have one   i see my husband coming at last     damn   muttered samson under his breath   she had expected her husband by the big gate  but he came through the little one  and she caught sight of him at once because through the corner of her eye she was watching some one else  umra the beggar  umra departed through the little gate thirty seconds before her husband entered it   blaine was so jubilant over a sample of crushed quartz he had brought home with him that there was no concealing his high spirits   he was even cordial to samson  whom he detested  and so full of the milk of human kindness toward everybody else that they all wanted to stay and be amused by him   but tess got rid of them at last by begging samson to go first ostentatiously and set them an example  which he did after extracting a promise from her to see him tete a tete again at the earliest opportunity   then tess showed her husband the letter that tom s dog had thrust into her hand    you dine alone tonight  dick  unless you prefer the club   i m going at once   read this    it was written in a fine italic hand on

look   look and wonder how the simple folk are out of it  empirics are the teachers and the liars leading men  we were generous and free   aye  a social lot were we  but they took to priests instead of us  and trouble started then       in hindu mythology yum is the judge of the dead and chitragupta writes the record for him      peace  maharajah sahib   out of anger came no wise counsel yet    tom tripp had done exactly what yasmini ordered him   like his dog trotters  whom he had schooled to perfection  and as he would have liked to have the maharajah s guards behave  he always fell back on sheer obedience whenever facts bewildered him or circumstances seemed too strong   yasmini had ordered him to report to the maharajah a chance encounter with an individual named gunga singh   accordingly he did   asked who gunga singh was  he replied he did not know   she had told him to say that gunga singh said the princess yasmini was at the commissioner s house   so he told the maharajah that and nothing further   gungadhura sent two men immediately to make inquiries   one drew the commissioner s house blank  bribing a servant to let him search the place in samson s absence   the other met the commissioner himself  and demanded of him point blank what he had been doing with the princess   the question was so bluntly put and the man s attitude so impudent that samson lost his temper and couched his denial in blunt bellicose bad language  the vehemence convinced the questioner that he was lying  as the maharajah was shortly informed   so the fact became established beyond the possibility of refutation that yasmini had been closeted with samson for several hours that morning   remained  of course  to consider why she had gone to him and what might result from her visit   and up to a certain point  and in certain cases accurate guessing is easier than might be expected for either side to a political conundrum  in india  ample provision having been made for it by all concerned   the english are fond of assuring strangers and one another that spying is  un english    that it  isn t done  you know  old top    and the surest way of heaping public scorn and indignation on the enemies of england is to convict them  correctly or otherwise  of spying on england secretly  so it would be manifestly libelous  ungentlemanly and proof conclusive of crass ignorance to assert that samson in his capacity of commissioner employed spies to watch gungadhura singh   he had no public fund from which to pay spies   if you don t believe that  then ponder over a copy of the indian estimates   every rupee is accounted for   the members of the maharajah s household who came to see samson at more or less frequent intervals were individuals of the native community whom he encouraged to intimacy for ethnological and social reasons  when they gave him information about gungadhura s doings  that was merely because they were incurably addicted to gossip   as a gentleman  and in some sense a representative of his majesty the king  he would not dream  of course  of paying attention to any such stuff   but one could not  of course  be so rude and high handed as to stop their talking even if it did tend toward an accurate foreknowledge of the maharajah s doings that was hardly  cricket    as for money  certainly none changed hands   the indisputable fact that certain friends and relatives of certain members of the maharajah s household enjoyed rather profitable contracts on british administered territory was coincidence   everybody knows how long is the arm of coincidence   well  then  so are its ears  and its tongue   as for the maharajah  the rascal went the length of paying spies in british government offices   there was never any knowing who was a spy of his and who wasn t   people were everlastingly crossing the river from the native state to seek employment in some government department or other  and one could not investigate them really thoroughly   it was so easy to forge testimonials and references and what not   one of samson s grooms had once been caught red handed eavesdropping in the dark   samson  of course  took the law into his own hands on that occasion and thrashed the blackguard within an inch of his treacherous life   and in proof that the thrashing was richly deserved  some one reported to samson the very next day how the groom had gone straight to the maharajah and had been solaced with silver money   it was even said  although never proved  that the fat  short sighted young babu sita ram who typed the commissioner s official correspondence was one of gungadhura s spies   there was a mystery about where he spent his evenings   but his mother s uncle was a first class magistrate  so one could not very well dismiss him without clear proof   besides  he was uncommonly painstaking and efficient   one way and another it is easy to see that gungadhura had a deal of dovetailed information from which to draw conclusions as to the probable reason of yasmini s alleged visit to the commissioner   one false conclusion invariably leads to another  and so samson got the blame for the secret bargain with the rangar stable owner  with whose connivance yasmini had contrived to keep a carriage available outside her palace gates   her palace gates having closed on the carriage now  the guards would pay attention that it stayed inside  but there was no knowing how many riding horses she might have at her beck and call in various khans and places   doubtless samson had arranged for that   gungadhura sent men immediately to search sialpore for horses that might be held in waiting for her  with orders to hire or buy the animals over her head  or in the alternative to lame them   as for her motive in visiting the commissioner  that was not far to seek  there was only one motive in sialpore for anything  the treasure   no doubt samson lusted for it as sinfully and lustily and craftily as any one  if  thought gungadhura  yasmini had a clue to its whereabouts  as she might have  then whoever believed she was not trafficking with the commissioner must be a simpleton   the commissioner was known to have written more than one very secret report to simla on the subject of the treasure  and on the political consequences that might follow on its discovery by natives of the country   the reports had been so secret and important that gungadhura had thought it worth while to have the blotting paper from samson s desk photographed in paris by a special process   adding two and two together now by the ancient elastic process  gungadhura soon reached the stage of absolute conviction that yasmini was in league with samson to forestall him in getting control of the treasure of his ancestors   and gungadhura was a dark  hot blooded  volcanic tempered man  who stayed not on the order of his anger but blew up at once habitually   we have seen how he came careering down street just in time to behold yasmini s carriage rumble into her stone paved palace courtyard   after ordering the guards not to let her escape again on pain of unnamed  but no less likely because illegal punishment  he rode full pelt to the temple of jinendra  whence they assured him yasmini had just come  and his spurs rang presently on the temple floor like the footfalls of avenging deity   jinendra s priest welcomed him with that mixture of deference and patronage that priests have always known so well how to extend to royalty  showing him respect because priestly recognition of his royalty entitled him in logic to the outward form of it  patronage because  as the  wisest fool in christendom  remarked   no bishop no king    the combination of sarcastic respect and contemptuous politeness produced an insolence that none except kings would tolerate for a moment   but jinendra s fat high priest could guess how far he dared go  as shrewdly as a marksman s guesses windage    she has betrayed us   that foreign she bastard has betrayed us   shouted gungadhura  slamming the priest s private door behind him and ramming home the bolt as if it fitted into the breach of a rifle    peace   peace  maharajah sahib   out of anger came no wise counsel yet     she has been to the commissioner s house     i know it     you know it   then she told you    the priest was about to lie  but gungadhura saved him    i know she was here   he burst out    my men followed her home     yes  she was here   she told     how did you make her tell   the she devil is more cunning than a cobra    jinendra s high priest smiled complacently    a servant of the gods  such as i am  is not altogether without power  i found a way   she told     i  too  will find a way   muttered gungadhura to himself   then to the priest    what did she say   why did she go to the commissioner     to ask a favor     of course   what favor     that she may go to europe     then there is no longer any doubt whatever   by saraswati  the goddess of wisdom  i know that she has discovered where the treasure is     my son   said the priest   it is not manners to call on other gods by name in this place     by jinendra  then   thou fat sedentary appetite  what a great god thine must be  that he can choose no cleverer servant than thee to muddle his affairs  while you were lulling me to sleep with dreams about a clue to be found in a cellar  she has already sucked the secret out from some cobra s hole and has sold it to the commissioner   as soon as he has paid her a proportion of it she will escape to europe to avoid me  will she     but the commissioner refused the desired permission   said the priest  puffing his lips and stroking his stomach  as much as to add   it s no use getting impatient in jinendra s temple   we have all the inside information here     what do you make of that   demanded gungadhura   the priest smiled   one does not explain everything to a mere maharajah  but the mere maharajah was in no mood to be put off with smiles just then   as yasmini got the story afterward from the bald old mendicant  whose piety had recently won him permission to bask on the comfortable carved stones just outside the window  gungadhura burst forth into such explosive profanity that the high priest ran out of the room   the mendicant vowed that he heard the door slam  and so he did   but it was really gungadhura  done with argument  on his way to put threat into action   the mildest epithet he called yasmini was  widyadhara   which meant in his interpretation of the word that she was an evil spirit condemned to roam the earth because her sins were so awful that the other evil spirits simply could not tolerate her    it is plain that the commissioner fears to let her go to europe   swore gungadhura    therefore it is plain that she and he have a plan between them to loot the treasure and say nothing   neither trusts the other  as is the way of such people   he will not let her out of sight until he can leave india himself     he has promised to send european memsahibs to call on her   said the priest  and the maharajah gnashed his teeth and swore like a man stung by a hornet    that is to prevent me from using violence on her   he will have frequent reports as to her health   after a time  when he has his fingers in the treasure  he will not be so anxious about her welfare     there was another matter that she told me   said the priest    repeat it then  belly of jinendra   thy paunch retains a tale too long     tripe  the drill master  is a welcome guest at the house built by jengal singh     what of it     he may enter even when the sahibs are away from home   the servants have orders to admit him     well    the priest smiled again    if it should chance to be true that the princess knows the secret of the treasure  and that she is selling it to the commissioner  tripe could enter that house and discover the clue   who could rob you of the treasure once you knew the secret of its hiding place    it was at that point that the maharajah grew so exasperated at the thought of another s knowledge of a secret that he considered rightly his own by heritage  that his language exceeded not only the bounds of decorum but the limits of commonplace blasphemy as well   turning his back on the priest he rushed from the room  slamming the door behind him  and  being a ruminant fat mortal  the priest sat so still considering on which side of the equation his own bread might be buttered as to cause the impression that the room was empty   whereas only the maharajah had left it   and a little later the babu sita ram came in   gungadhura was in no mood to be trifled with   he knew pretty well where to find tom tripe during any of the hours of duty  so he cornered him without delay and  glaring at him with eyes like an animal s at bay  ordered him to search the blaine s house at the first opportunity    search for what   demanded tripe    for anything   for everything   search the cellar   search the garden  search the roof   are you a fool   are you fit for my employment   then search the house  and report to me anything unusual that you find in it   go    after several stiff brandies and soda gungadhura then conceived a plan that might have been dangerous supposing yasmini to have been less alert  and supposing that she really knew the secret   he spent an evening coaching patali  his favorite dancing girl  and then sent her to yasmini with almost full powers to drive a bargain   she might offer as much as half of the treasure to yasmini provided gungadhura should receive the other half and the british should know nothing   that was the one point on which patali s orders permitted no discretion   the whole transaction must be secret from the british   reporting the encounter afterward to her employer patali hardly seemed proud of her share in it   all the information she brought back was to the effect that yasmini denied all knowledge of the treasure  and all desire to possess it    i think she knows nothing   she said very little to me   she laughed at the idea of bargaining with englishmen   she said you are welcome to the treasure  maharajah sahib  and that if she should ever find its hiding place she will certainly tell you   she plays the part of a woman whose spirit is already broken and who is weary of india    having a very extensive knowledge of dancing girls and their ways  gungadhura did not believe much more than two per cent  of patali s account of what had taken place  and he was right  except that he grossly overestimated her truthfulness   and even with his experienced cynicism it never entered his head to suppose that patali was the individual who warned yasmini in advance of the preparations being made to poison her by gungadhura s orders   yet  as it was patali s own sister who made the sweetmeats  and tampered with the charcoal for the filter  and put the powdered diamonds in the chutney  it was likely enough that patali would know the facts   and as for motives  dancing girls don t have them  they fear  they love  they desire  they seek to please   if yasmini could pluck heart strings more cleverly than gungadhura could break and bruise them  so much the worse for gungadhura s plans  that was all  as far as patali was concerned   for several days after that  as yasmini more than hinted in her letter to tess  repeated efforts were made to administer poison in the careful undiscoverable ways that india has made her own since time immemorial  but you can not easily poison any one who does not eat  and who drinks wine that was bottled in europe   or at any rate  to do it you must call in experts who are expensive in the first place as well as adepts at blackmail in the second   yasmini enjoyed a charmed life and an increasing appetite  gungadhura s guards attending to it however  that she took no more forbidden walks and rides and swims by moonlight to make the hunger really unendurable   supplies were allowed to pass through the palace gate  after they had been tampered with   finally gungadhura  biting his nails and drinking whisky in the intervals between consultation with a dozen different sets of priests  made up his mind to drastic action   it dawned on his exasperated mind that every single priest  including jinendra s obese incumbent  was trying to take advantage of his predicament in order to feather a priestly nest or forward plans diametrically opposed to his own    not that recognition of priestly deception made him less superstitious  or any less dependent on the priest   if that were the way discovery worked  all priests would have vanished long ago   it simply made him furious  like a tiger in a net  and spurred him to wreak damage in which the priests might have no hand    whisky  drugs  reflection and the hints of twenty dancing girls convinced him that jinendra s priest especially was playing a double game   for what was there in the fat man s mental ingredients that should anchor his loyalty to an ill tempered prince  in case a princess of wit and youth and brilliant beauty should stake her cunning in the game   why was not yasmini already ten times dead of poison   nothing but the cunning inspired by partnership with priests  and alertness born of secret knowledge  could have given her the intelligence to order her maids to boil a present of twenty pairs of french silk stockings  nor the malice to hang them afterward with her own hands on a line across her palace roof in full view of gungadhura s window   hatred of yasmini was an obsession of his in any case   he had loathed her mother  who dared try to wear down the rule that women must be veiled   even his own dancing girls were heavily veiled in public  and all his relations with women of any sort took place behind impenetrable screens   he was a stickler for that sort of thing and  like others of his kidney  rather proud of the rumors that no curtains could confine   so he loathed and despised yasmini even more than he had detested her mother  because she coupled to her mother s western notions about freedom a wholly eastern ability to take advantage of restraint  in other words she was too clever for him   on top of all that she had dared outrage his royal feelings by refusing to be given in marriage to the husband be selected for her  a fine  black  bristling  stout cavalier of sixty with a wife or two already and impoverished estates that would have swallowed yasmini s fortune nicely at a gulp  incidentally  the husband would have eagerly canceled a gambling debt in exchange for a young wife with an income   there was no point at which yasmini and himself could meet on less than rapier terms   her exploits in disguise were notorious  so notorious that men sang songs about them in the drinking places and the khans  and as if that were not bad enough there was a rumor lately that she had turned abhisharika   the word is sanskrit and poetic   to the ordinary folk  who like to listen to love stories by moonlight on the roofs or under trees  that meant that she had chosen her own lover and would go to him  when the time should come  of her own free will   to gungadhura  naturally  such a word bore other meanings   as we have said  he was a stickler for propriety   last  and most uncomfortable crime of all  it seemed that she had now arranged with samson to have english ladies call on her at intervals  not a prophet on earth could guess where that might lead to  and to what extremes of western fashion   for though one does not see the high caste women of rajputana  they themselves see everything and know all that is going on   but it needed no prophet to explain that a woman visited at intervals by the wives of english officers could not be murdered easily or safely   all arguments pointed one way   he must have it out with yasmini in one battle royal   if she should be willing to surrender  well and good  he would make her pay for the past  but no doubt there were certain concessions that he could yield without loss of dignity   if she knew the secret of the hiding place of the treasure he would worm it out of her  there are ways  he reflected  of worming secrets from a woman  ways and means   if she knew the secret and refused to tell  then he knew how to provide that she should never tell any one else   if she had told some one else already   samson  for instance  or jinendra s priest   then he would see to it that priest or commissioner  as the case might be  must carry on without the cleverest member of the firm   but he must hurry   poison apparently would not work and he did not dare murder her outright  much as he would have liked to   it was maddening to think how one not very violent blow with a club or a knife would put an end to her wilfulness forever  and yet that the risk to himself in that case would be almost as deadly as the certainty for her  but accidents might happen   in a land of elephants  tigers  snakes  wild boars and desperate men there is a wide range for circumstance  and the sooner the accident the less the risk of interference by some inquisitive english woman with a ticket of admission signed by samson   an  accident  in yasmini s palace  he decided would be nearly as risky as murder   but he had a country place fifty miles away in the mountains  to which she could be forcibly removed  thus throwing inquisitive englishwomen off the scent for a while at any rate   that secluded little hunting box stood by a purple lake that had already drowned its dozens  not always without setting up suspicion   and between the city of sialpore and the  nesting place of seven swans  lay leagues of wild road on which anything at all might happen and be afterward explained away   as for the forcible abduction  that could best be got around by obliging her to write a letter to himself requesting permission to visit the mountains for a change of air and scenery   there were ways and means of obliging women to write letters   best of all  of course  would be yasmini s unconditional surrender  because then he would be able to make use of her wits and her information  instead of having to explain away her  accident  and cope alone with any one whom she might already have entrusted with her secret   there should be a strenuous effort first to bring her to her senses   physical pain  he had noticed  had more effect on people s senses than any amount of argument   there had been a very amusing instance recently  one of his dancing girls named malati had refused recently to sing and dance her best before a man to whom gungadhura had designed to make a present of her   but the mere preliminaries of removing a toe nail behind the scenes had changed her mind within three minutes   then there were other little humorous contrivances   there is a way of tying an intended convert to your views in such ingenious fashion that the lightest touch of a finger on taut catgut stretched from limb to limb  causes exquisite agony   and a cigarette end  of course  applied in such circumstances to the tenderer parts has great power to persuade   as to accomplices  those must be few and carefully chosen   alone against yasmini he knew he would have no chance whatever  for she was physically stronger than a panther  and as swift and graceful   but there are creatures  not nearly yet extinct from eastern courts  known as eunuchs  whose strongest quality is seldom said to be mercy  and whose chief business in life is to be amenable to orders and to guard with their lives their master s secrets   three were really too many to be let into such a secret   but it had needed two to hold malati properly while the third experimented on the toe nail  and yasmini was much stronger than malati   so he must chance it and take three   the only remaining problem did not trouble him much   the palace guards were his own men  and were therefore not likely to question his right to ignore the first law of purdah that forbids the crossing of a woman s threshold  especially after dark  unless she is your property  besides  they all knew already what sort of prowl by night their master was  and laws  especially such laws  were  made for other people  not for maharajahs       chapter seven     a bloody enlisted man  that s me  a peg in the officer s plan  maybe  drunk on occasion  disgrace to a nation and proper societee  yet i ve a notion the sky  pure blue ain t more essential than i  clear through  i m a man   i can think  in the chain of eternal affairs i m a link  and the chain ain t no stronger than me  or you     that will be the end of gungadhura    it took longer to get the hamper ready than tess expected  partly because it did not seem expedient to have the butler chamu in the secret   by the time she and her husband were up side by side in the dog cart there was already a nearly full moon silvering the sky  and the jackals were yelping miserably on the hillside   before they reached the stifling town a slow breeze had moved the river mist  until a curtain shut off the whole of the bazaar and merchants  quarters from the better residential section where the palaces stood   it was an ideal night for adventure   an almost perfect night for crime   one could step from street to street and leave no clue  because of the drifting vapor   here and there a solitary policeman coughed after they had passed  or slunk into a shadow lest they recognize and report him for sleeping at his post   all sahibs have unreasonable habits  and not even a constable can guess which one will not make trouble for him   an occasional stray dog yapped at the wheels  and more than once heads peered over roof tops to try and glimpse them  because gossip  especially about sahibs who are out after dark  is a coinage of its own that buys welcome and refreshment almost anywhere   but nothing in particular happened until the horse struck sparks from the granite flagstones outside yasmini s gate  and a sleepy rajput sentry brought his rifle to the challenge   then it was not exactly obvious what to do next   tess felt perfectly confident on the high seat  with the pistol in her husband s pocket pressing against her and his reassuring bulk between her and the sentry   but everywhere else was insecurity and doubt   one does not as a rule descend from dog carts after dark and present half sheets of paper by way of passports for admission to rajput palaces   the sentry looked mildly interested  no more   he had been so thoroughly warned and threatened in case of efforts to escape from within  that it did not enter his head that any one might want to enter   however  since the dog cart continued to stand still in front of the gate  he turned the guard out as a matter of routine   one never knew when sahibs will not complain about discourtesy   the guard lined up at attention  eight men and a risaldar  officer   double the regular number by gungadhura s orders   the risaldar stepped up close to the dog cart and spoke to the man he imagined was the sais  using  as was natural  the rajput tongue   but dick blaine only knew enough of the language for fetch and carry purposes  not enough to deceive a native as to his nationality after the first two words    now i feel foolish   said tess  and the risaldar of the guard thrust his bearded face closer  supposing she spoke to him   dick answered her    shall i drive you home again  little woman   say  the word and we re off     not yet   i haven t tried my ammunition    she pulled out samson s scribbled permit and was about to offer it to the guard   but there was a risk that whatever she did would only arouse and increase his suspicions  and she offered it nervously    what if he won t give it back to you   asked her husband    oh  dick  you re a regular prophet of evil tonight    however  she withdrew the paper before the guard s fingers  closed on it   the next moment a figure like a phantom  making no noise  almost made her scream   dick produced a repeating pistol with that sudden swiftness that proves old acquaintance with the things  and the corporal of the guard sprang back with a shout of warning to his men  imagining the pistol was intended for himself   tess recovered presence of mind first    it s all right  dick   put the gun out of sight    she stretched out her hand and a cold nose touched her finger ends  sniffing them   a dog s forefeet were on the shaft  and his eyes gleamed balefully in the carriage lamp light    good trotters   good boy  trotters    she remembered tom tripe s lecture about calling dogs by name  wondering whether the rule applied to owners only  or whether she  too  could make the creature  do this own thinking    before she could decide what she would like the dog to think about he was gone again as silently as he had come   the guard was thoroughly on the qui vive by that time  if not suspicious  then officious   how should one protect the privacy of a palace gate if unknown memsahibs in dog carts  with saises who knew english but did not answer when spoken to in the native tongue  were to be allowed to draw up in front of the gate at unseemly hours and remain there indefinitely   the risaldar ordered tess away without further ceremony  making his meaning plain by taking the horse s head and starting him   dick blaine drew the horse back on his haunches and cursed the man for that piece of impudence  in language and with mannerisms that banished forever any delusions as to his nationality   and it occurred to the officer that his extra complement of men  standing in a row like dummies at attention  were not there after all for nothing   he despatched two of them at a run to gungadhura s palace  the one to tell the story of what had happened and the other to add to it whatever the first might omit   between them they were likely to produce results of some sort    now we re done for   sighed tess    no chance tonight  i m afraid  if only i d done what she told me to and consulted with tom tripe first  better drive home now  dick  before we make the case worse    the unreasonableness of the attempt convinced and discouraged her  it was like a nightmare   but as dick reined the horse about there came out of the mist the sound of another horse at a walk  and two men marching in step   then a man s voice broke the stillness   dick reined in  and a second later trotters  huge paws rested on the shaft again  tess could see his long  unenthusiastic tail wagging to and fro    tom   she called   tom tripe     coming  lady    three figures emerged out of the gloom  one of them mounted and loquacious    i d like to know what these rascally guards are doing off their post  give these sons of camp followers an inch and they ll take three leagues  every mother s son of them   halt  there  you   now then  where s your officer   give an account of yourselves    there followed an interlude in rajasthani    tom tripe becoming more blasphemously vehement as it grew clearer that the risaldar had done entirely right     the native language of rajputana     lady   he said presently  riding round to tess s side of the dog cart   i m going to have hard work to convince this man   i d orders from gungadhura to search your house  krishna knows what for  and i rode up to ask your leave to do it  hoping you d be alone after the party  chamu told me you and your husband had gone out  and one of the three beggars gave me a message intended for you that tallied pretty close with one i knew you d received already  so i guessed where to head for  and sent the dog in advance   he came back with his hair on end reporting trouble  and then as luck would have it i rode into these two men on their way to gungadhura   if they d reached him  we d all have had to make new plans tomorrow morning   you want to see the princess  of course   but what have you got that can get by the guard    tess produced samson s scribbled note  and he studied it in the carriage lamplight   then she recalled yasmini s warning that tom tripe had no brains and must be told what to do   her own wits began to work desperately    i m the lady doctor  tom   that is my written order from the burra sahib    commissioner    tom scratched his head and swore in a low voice fervently    the difficulty s this  lady   since the escape from the palace across the river  the maharajah has taken the posting of palace guards out of my hands entirely   i ve still the duty to inspect and make sure they re on the job  oh  i see   i have it    he turned on the corporal with all the savagery that the white man generates in contact with eastern subordinates    what do you mean   he demanded in the man s own language   by standing in the way of the maharajah sahib s orders   here s his highness sending a lady doctor to the princess for an excuse to confine her elsewhere and have all this trouble off our hands  and you  like a blockhead  stand in the way to prevent it   see  there s the letter    the rajput looked perplexed   all the world knows what privileges the rare american women doctors enjoy in that land of sealed seraglios    but it is written in english   he objected    the maharajah sahib does not write english     idiot   of what use would a letter in persian be to an american lady doctor     but to me   it is i who command the guard and must read the letter  how can i read the letter     i ll read it to you   what s more  i ll explain it   the princess has been appealing to the commissioner sahib     the rajput nodded   it was all over town that yasmini had been closeted with the commissioner on the morning of her recent escape   she herself had deliberately sown the seeds of that untruth    so the commissioner sahib and the maharajah sahib had a conference     the rajput nodded again   it was common knowledge  too that the commissioner and gungadhura had had a rather stormy interview the day before   and it was none of the corporal s privilege to know that all they had argued about was the ill treatment of prisoners in the sialpore jail      it was agreed at the conference that if the princess can be proved mad  then the maharajah sahib may do as he s minded about sending her away into the hills   if she s not mad  then he s to give her her liberty  do you understand  you dunderhead     hah  i understand   but why at night   why not the maharajah sahib s signature in his own writing     son of incomprehension   does the maharajah sahib wish still more scandal than already has been by permitting such a visit in the daytime  strike me everlasting dumb if he hasn t had more than enough already  does he want the responsibility   does he wish the british to say afterward that it was all the maharajah s doing   no  you ass   at the conference be agreed solely on condition that the commissioner sahib should sign the letter and relieve his highness of all blame in case of a verdict of madness   and it was decided to send an american  lest there be too much talk among the british themselves   now  do you understand     hah   i understand   if all this is true the matter is easy   i will send one of the guard with that letter to the maharajah sahib   he will write his name on it and send it back  and all is well     suit yourself   sneered tom tripe    the maharajah sahib is with his dancing girls this minute   what happened to the last man who interrupted his amusements    the rajput hesitated   the answer to that question could be seen any day near the place they call the old gate  where beggars sit in rags    shall i offer him money   whispered tess    for god s sake  no  lady   the man s a decent soldier   he d refuse it and we d all be in the apple cart   leave him to me    he turned again on the rajput    you know who i am  don t you   you know it s my duty to see that the palace guards attend to business  eh   that s why i m here tonight  his highness particularly warned me to see that if anything unusual wanted doing it should get done   if you want to question my authority you ll have it out with me before his highness in the morning first thing    the rajput obviously wavered   everybody knew that the first thing in the morning was no good time to appear on charges before a man who spent his nights as gungadhura did    who is to enter   a man and a woman     no  you idiot   a lady doctor only   and nobody s to know   you d better warn your men that if there s any talk about this night s business the palace guard will catch the first blast of the typhoon   gungadhura s anger isn t mild in these days     show me the letter again   said the rajput    let me keep it in case i am brought to book    tom translated that to tess and her husband    it s this way  ma am   if you let him keep the letter i suspect he ll let you go in   but he may show it to the maharajah in the morning  and then there ll be hot fat in the fire   if you don t let him keep it  perhaps he ll admit you and perhaps he won t   but if you keep the letter  and trouble comes of it  he and i ll both be in the soup   never mind about me   maybe i m too valuable to be sent packing   i ll take the chance   but this man s a decent soldier  and he d be helpless     let him keep it   said tess   tom turned on the rajput again    here s the letter   take it   but mark this   what his highness wants tonight is discretion   there might be promotion for a man who d say nothing about this night s work   if  on top of that  he was soldier enough to keep his men from talking he d be reported favorably to his highness by tom tripe   who got you made risaldar  eh   who stood up for you  when you were charged with striking gullam singh   was tom tripe s friendship worth having then   now suit yourself   i ve said all i m going to say    the rajput muttered something in his beard  stared again at the letter as if that of itself would justify him  looked sharply at tess  whose hamper might or might not be corroborative evidence  folded the letter away in his tunic pocket  and made a gesture of assent    now  lady  hurry   said tom    and here s hoping you re right about there being no hell   i ve told lies enough tonight to damn my soul forever  once you re safely through the gate i ll have a word or two more with the guard  and then your husband and i will go to a place close by that i know of and wait for you    but tess objected to that    please don t leave me waiting for you in the dark outside the gate when i return   why not keep the carriage here  my husband won t mind     might make talk  ma am   i ll leave trotters here to watch for you   he ll bring word in less than a minute    tom tripe dismounted to help her out of the dog cart   the rajput struck the iron gate as if he expected to have to wake the dead and take an hour about it   but it opened suspiciously quickly and a bearded afridi  of all unlikely people  thrust an expectant face outward  rather like a tortoise emerging from its shell  blinking as he tried to recognize the shadowy forms that moved in the confusing lamplight   he seemed to know whom to expect and admit  for he beckoned tess with a long crooked forefinger the moment she approached the gate  and in another ten seconds the iron clanged behind her  shutting her off from husband and all present hope of succor   the chance of any rescuer entering the palace that night  whether by force or subtlety  was infinitesimal   the strange gateman  he had a little kennel of a place to sleep in just inside the entrance  snatched the hamper from tess and led her almost at a run across an ancient courtyard whose outlines were nearly invisible except where the yellow light of one ancient oil lantern on an iron bracket showed a part of the palace wall and a steep flight of stone steps  worn down the middle by centuries of sandals   everything else was in gloom and shadow  and only one chink of light betrayed the whereabouts of a curtained window   the afridi led her up the stone steps  and paused at the top to hammer on a carved door with his clenched fist   but the door moved while his fist was in mid air  and the merry eyed maid who opened it mocked him for a lunatic   dumb  apparently  in the presence of woman  he slunk down the steps again  leaving tess wondering whether it were not good manners to remove her shoes before entering  natives of the country always removed their shoes before entering her house  and she supposed it would be only decent to reciprocate   however  the maid took her by the hand and pulled her inside without further ceremony  not letting go of the hand even to close the door  but patting it and making much of her  smiling the welcome that they had no words in common to express   the little outer hall in which they stood was shut off by curtains six yards high  all smothered in a needlework of peacocks that generations of patient fingers must have toiled at  pulling these apart the maid led her into an inner hall fifty or sixty feet long  the first sight of which banished all diffidence about her shoes  for never had she seen such medley of east and west  such toning down of oriental mysticism with the sheer utility of european importations  and that without incongruity   the lamps  of which there were dozens  were mostly russian   some of the furniture was buhl  some french   there were hangings that looked like loot from the pekin summer palace  and tapestry from gobelin   in a place of honor on a side wall was an ikon  framed in gold  and facing that an image of the buddha done in greenish bronze  flanked by a dutch picture of the twelve apostles with laughably dutch faces receiving instruction on a mountain from a christ whose other name was surely hans   down the center of the hall  leading to a gallery  was a magnificent stairway of marble and lapis lazuli  carpeted with long bokhara strips so well joined end to end that the whole looked like one piece   and at the top of those stairs yasmini stood waiting  her golden hair illuminated by glass lamps on either marble column at the stairhead   she was as different from the gunga singh of riding boots and turban as the morning is from night  the loveliest  bewitchingest girl in silken gossamer that tess had ever set eyes on    i knew you would come   she shouted gleefully    i knew you would get in   i knew you are my friend   oh  i m glad   i m glad    she pirouetted a dozen times on bare toes at the top of the stairs  spinning until her silken skirts expanded in a nimbus  then danced down stairs into tess s arms  where she clung  panting and laughing    i m so hungry   oh  i m hungry   did you bring the food     i m ashamed   tess answered    the man set it down outside the door and i left it there    but yasmini gave a little shrill of delight  and tess turned to see that another maid had brought it    how many of you are there     five     thank heaven   i ve brought enough for a square meal for a dozen     we have eaten a little  little bit each day of the servants  rice  washing it first for hours  until today  when two of the servants were taken sick and we thought perhaps their food was poisoned too   oh  we re hungry    hasamurti  yasmini s maid  opened the basket on the floor and crowed aloud   tess apologized    i knew nothing about the caste restrictions  but i ve put in meat jelly   and bread  and fruit  and rice  and nuts  and milk  and tea  and wine   and sugar     yasmini laughed    i am as western as i choose to be  and only pretend to caste when i see fit   my maids do as i do  or they seek another mistress   come    hasamurti would have spread a banquet there on the floor  but yasmini led them up stairs  holding tess by the hand  turning to the right at the stairhead into a room all cream and golden  lighted by hanging lamps that shone through disks of colored glass   there she pulled tess down beside her on to a great soft divan and they all ate together  the maids munching their share while they served their mistress   they devoured the milk  and left the wine  eating  all things considered  astonishingly moderately    now we ought all to go to sleep   announced yasmini  yawning  and then bubbling with delighted laughter at the expression of tess s face   the people outside might wait     great heavens  child   do you suppose i can stay here indefinitely   tess demanded    i must be gone in an hour or my husband will murder the guard and force an entrance     i will have just such a husband soon   announced yasmini    when i send him one little word  he will cut the throats of thirty men and come to me through flames   let us try your husband   she added as an afterthought  then laughed again at tess s expression of dissent  and nodded    i  too  will be careful how i risk my husband   men are but moths in a woman s hands  fragile  but the good ones are precious   besides  we have no time tonight for sport   i must escape    evidently tess was causing her exquisite amusement   the thought of being an accomplice in any such adventure stirred all her yankee common sense to its depths  and she had none of the eastern trick of not displaying her emotions    nonsense  child   let me go to the commissioner and warn him that you are being starved to death in this place   i will threaten him with public scandal if he doesn t put an end to it at once     pouf   laughed yasmini    samson sahib would make a nice clumsy accomplice   he would send me to calcutta  where i should be poisoned sooner or later for a certainty  because gungadhura would send agents to attend to that   they would wait months and months for their opportunity  and i can not always stay awake   meanwhile samson sahib would claim praise from his government  and they would put some more initials at the end of his name  and promote him to a bigger district with more pay  no   samson sahib shall have another district surely  but even he in his conceit will not consider it promotion   there will not be room for samson sahib in sialpore when i am maharanee     you maharanee   it was you yourself who told me that gungadhura has lots of children  who all stand between you and the throne   do you mean      again the bell like laugh announced utter enjoyment of tess s bewilderment    no  i will kill nobody   i will not even send snakes in a basket to gungadhura  that scorpion shall sting himself to death if he sees fit  with a ring of the fire of ridicule all about him and no friends to console him  and no hope  nothing but disappointment and fear and rage   i will kill nobody  yet i will be maharanee within the month    suddenly she grew deadly serious  her young face darkening as the sky does when a quick cloud hides the sun    what is your husband s contract with gungadhura   may he dig for gold anywhere   he is digging now  isn t he  close to the british fort on the  island  in our territory  that fort with the flagstaff on it that can be seen from gungadhura s roof   he is wasting time     he has found a little vein of gold   said tess   that will likely lead to a bigger vein     he is wasting time   sita ram  who has a compass  and who knows all that goes on in samson sahib s office  sent me word that the little vein of gold runs nearly due north   in another week at the rate the men are digging your husband will be under the fort   that is english territory  the english have nothing to do with gungadhura s contract   they will take the gold your husband finds and give him nothing   then samson sahib would be considered a most excellent commissioner and would surely get promotion   pouf     perhaps my husband can make a separate bargain with the english     pouf   samson sahib is an idiot  but he is not fool enough to give away what would be in his hands already   i myself  hidden beneath your window  heard him give you clear warning on that point   no  there must be another plan   your husband must dig elsewhere     but  my dear  gungadhura knows already that my husband has found a  leader    he is all worked up about it  and goes every day to watch the progress     surely  knowing as well as i do that the vein is leading toward the fort  he goes afterward to the priests  and prays that the vein of gold may turn another way and save him from bankruptcy   listen   i speak truth  i speak to you woman to woman  womb to womb   i will count myself accursed  and will let a cobra bite me if i tell you now one word that is not true   do you believe i am going to tell you the truth    tess nodded   yasmini  by her own admission  would lie deliberately when that suited her   but the truth tells itself  as it were  and there is no mistaking it  except by such as lie invariably  of whom there is a multifarious host    if your husband continues digging near the fort he will get nothing  because the english will take it all   if he digs in a certain other place he will get a very great fortune     but  my dear  supposing that is quite true  how shall he convince gungadhura  after all the outlay and expense of the present operations  that it s best to abandon them and begin all over again in another place    yasmini lay back on the cushions  drew something out from under one of them  and laughed softly  as if enjoying a deep underflow of secret information    gungadhura himself shall insist on it     what   on starting again in a new place    yasmini nodded    only do as i say  and gungadhura himself shall insist     what do you wish me to do    tess was beginning to feel alarmed again   she knew to a rupee how much gungadhura had been obliged to pay out for the digging   to make herself responsible even in degree for the abandonment of all that outlay would be risky  even if no other construction could be placed on it    has tom tripe been told to search your house     yes  so he says     do you know the cellar of your house     yes     it is dark   are you afraid to go there     no  why     is there a flat stone in a corner of the cellar floor that once had a ring in it but the ring is broken out     yes     good   then sita ram did not lie to me   take this    she gave her a little silver tube  capped at either end and sealed heavily with wax   there is a writing inside it  done in persian   hide that under the stone  and let tom tripe search the cellar and find it there   but forbid him to remove it     if i only knew what you are driving at   said tess with a wry smile   a clumsier conspirator might have lost the game at that point by over emphasis  for tess was wavering between point blank refusal and delay that would give her time to consult her husband   but yasmini  even at that age  was adept at feeling her way nicely   again she lay back on the cushion  and this time lit a cigarette  smoking lazily    the stake that i am playing for  the stake that i shall surely win   she said after a minute   is too big to be risked   if you are afraid  let us forget all that i have said   let us be friends and nothing more    tess did not answer   she recognized the appeal to her own pride  and ignored it   what she was thinking of was gungadhura s beastliness   his attempts to poison yasmini  his treatment of women generally   his cruelty to animals in the arena  his viciousness   and then  of how much more queenly if nothing else  this girl would likely be than ever gungadhura could be kingly   it was tempting enough to have a hand in substituting yasmini for gungadhura on the throne of sialpore if the chance of doing it were real   yasmini seemed able to read her thoughts  or at all events to guess them    when i am maharanee   she said   there will be an end of gungadhura s swinishness   moreover  promises will all be kept  unwritten ones as well as written   gungadhura s contracts will be carried out   do you believe me     yes  i think i believe that     let tom tripe find that silver tube in your cellar then   but listen   when gungadhura comes to your husband and insists on digging elsewhere  let your husband bargain like a huckster   let him at first refuse   it may be that gungadhura will let him continue where he digs  and will himself send men to start digging in the other place   in that case  well and good     i would prefer that  said tess    my husband is a mining engineer  i think he would hate to abandon a true lead for a whim of some one s else    yasmini s bright eyes gleamed intelligence   she was only learning in those days to bend people to her own imperious will and to use others  virtues for own ends as readily as their vices   she recognized the necessity of yielding to tess s compunctions  more than suspecting that dick blaine would color his own views pretty much to suit his wife s in any case   and with a lightning ability peculiar to her she saw how to improve her own plan by yielding    that is settled  then   she said lazily    your husband shall continue to dig near the fort  if he so wishes   but let him show samson sahib some specimens of the gold  how little it is  how feeble  how uncertain   be sure he does that  please   that will be the end of gungadhura   and now it is time to escape from here  and for you to help me    tess resigned herself to the inevitable   whatever the consequences  she was not willing to leave yasmini to starve or be poisoned    i m ready   she said    what s the plan     i shall leave all the maids behind   they have food enough for the morning   in the morning  after it is known that i have escaped  word shall be sent to samson sahib that the women in this palace have nothing but poisoned food to eat   he must beard gungadhura about that or lose his own standing with the english     but how will you escape     nay  that is not the difficulty   your husband and tom tripe are waiting with the carriage   my part is easy   this is the problem   how will you follow me     i don t understand     i must wear your clothes   in the dark i shall get past the guard  making believe that i am you     then how shall i manage     you must do as i say   i can contrive it   come  the maids and i will make a true rajputni of you   only i must study how to walk as you do  please walk along in front of me  that way  follow hasamurti through that door into my room   i will study how you move your feet and shoulders    looking back as she followed hasamurti  tess witnessed a caricature of herself that made her laugh until the tears came    it is well   said yasmini    this night began in hunger  like the young moon   now is laughter without malice   in a few hours will be bright dawn  and after that  success        chapter eight     an elephant interlude  watch your step where the elephants sway each at a chain at the end of a day  hurrumdi didddlidi um di ay  nothing to do but rock and swing  clanking an iron picket ring  plucking the dust to flirt and fling  keep et ceteras out of range  anything out of the way or strange suits us elephant folk for change   various odds and ends appeal to liven the round of work and meal  curious trunks can reach and steal  fool with two tails if you dare  help yourself   but fool  beware  whatever results is your affair  we are the easiest beasts that be  gentle and good and affectionate we  you are the monarchs  we bow the knee  big and obese and obedient  um  just as long as it suits us  um  hurrumti tiddli di um ti um    unfortunately at this point akbar s attention was diverted to another matter  so the rest of his picket song goes unrecorded      they re elephants and i m a soldier   the trouble with you is nerves  my boy    there was brandy in the place that tom tripe knew of  brandy and tobacco and a smell of elephants   dick blaine  who scarcely ever touched strong liquor  having had intimate acquaintance with abuse of it in western mining camps  had to sit and endure the spectacle of tom s chief weakness  glass after glass of the fiery stuff descending into a stomach long since rendered insatiable by soldiering on peppery food in a climate that is no man s friend   he protested a dozen times    we may need our wits tonight  tom   suppose we both keep sober     man alive  i ve been doing this for years   brandy and brains are the same in my case   keep me without it  and by bedtime i m an invalid  give me all i want of it  and i m a crafty soldier man    dick blaine refilled his pipe and watched for an opportunity   he had heard that kind of argument before  and had conquered flood and fire with the aid of the very men who used it  that being the gift  or whatever you like to call it  that had made him independent while the others drew monthly pay in envelopes   it was a low oblong shed they sat in  with a wide door opening on a side street within four hundred yards of yasmini s palace gate   it was furnished with a table  two chairs and a cot for tom tripe s special use whenever the maharajah s business should happen to keep him on night duty  his own proper quarters being nearly a mile away  alongside the shed was a very rough stable that would accommodate a horse or two  and the back wall was a mere partition of mud brick  behind which  under a thatched roof  were tethered some of the maharajah s elephants   there were two windows in the wall  through which one could see dimly the great brutes  rumps as they swayed at their pickets restlessly   the smell came through a broken pane  and every once in a while the blaines  horse  standing ready in the shafts outside with a blanket over him  squealed at it indignantly   tom s horse dozed in the rough shed  being used to elephants   dick got up once or twice to peer through the window at the brutes    are they tethered fore and aft   he wondered    no   tom answered   one hind foot only     what s to stop them from turning round and breaking down this rotten wall     nothing  except that they re elephants   they could break their picket chains if they were minded to  same as i could break gungadhura s head and lose my job   but i won t do it  and nor will they   they re elephants  and i m a soldier   the trouble with you is nerves  my boy  have some brandy   you re worried about your wife  but i tell you she s right as a trivet   i d trust my last chance with that little princess   i ve done it often   brandy s the stuff to keep your hair on   have some    the bottle had only been three parts full   tom poured out the last of it and set a stone jorum of rum in readiness on the table over against the wall    wish we had hot water handy   he grumbled    which of the elephants are tethered here   asked dick    that big one that killed a tiger in the arena the other day     yes   did you see that   akbar was scarcely scratched   quickest thing ever i saw  squealed with rage the minute they turned  stripes  loose  chased him to the wall  downed him with a forefoot and crushed him into tiger jelly before you could say british constitution     i guess that tiger had been kept in a cage too long   said dick    don t you believe it   he was fighting fit   but they d given old akbar a skinfull of rum  and that turns him into a holy terror   he s quite quiet other times    dick looked at his watch   tess had been in the palace about three hours  and he was confident she would come away as soon as possible  if for no other reason than to put an end to his anxiety   she was likely to appear at the gate at any minute   at any minute tom tripe was likely to attack the jorum  and if present symptoms went for anything  it would not take much of it to make him worse than useless   at present he was growing reminiscent    once old akbar had a belly ache and they gave him arrak   they didn t catch him for two days   he pulled up his picket stake and lit out for the horizon  chasing dogs and hens and monkeys and anything else be could find that annoyed him   screamed like a locomotive   horrid sight     where does this road outside lead to   asked dick    don t lead anywhere   blind alley   why     oh  nothing    dick was examining the wall between the shed they sat in and the stable place next door   it was much stronger than the mud affair between them and the elephants   tom tripe had nearly finished his tumbler full  and there was madness in the air that night that made a man take awfully long chances    do you suppose a man could lose his way in the dark between here and the palace gate     not even if he was as drunk as noah   all he d have to do  ud be hold on to the wall and walk forward   the road turns a corner  but the walls are all blind and there s no other way but past the palace   you sit here  though  my boy   no need to try that   your wife s all right     well  maybe i d better stay here     sure     do you suppose i could back the dog cart into the shed where your horse is   i hardly like to leave my horse standing any longer in the open  yet he s better in the shafts in case we want him in a hurry     yes  the door s wide enough     then i ll do it     suit yourself   but take some of that rum before you go outside   the night air s bad for your lungs   help yourself and pass the bottle  as the queen said to the archbishop of canterbury     all right  i will    dick poured a little on his handkerchief  thrust the handkerchief through the broken pane and waved it violently to spread the smell   it was cheap  immodest stuff  blatant with its own advertisement   then he set the jorum down on the end of the table farthest from the wall  to the best of his judgment out of reach from the window    come along  tom   he said then   help me with the horse     what s your hurry   take a drink first     no  let s take one together afterward    he took tom by the shoulder and pushed him to his feet    the horse might break away   come on  man  hurry    over his shoulder dick could see a long trunk nosing its way gingerly through the broken pane and searching out the source of the alluring smell   he pushed tripe along in front of him  and together they backed the dog cart into the stable place  making a very clumsy business of it for three reasons   tom tripe was none too sober   the horse was nearly crazy with fear of the uncanny brutes just beyond the wall   and dick was in too much hurry for reasons of his own   however  they got horse and cart in backward  and the door shut before the crash came   the crash was of a falling mud brick wall  pushed outward by the shoulders of a pachyderm that wanted alcohol   the beast had had it out of all sorts of containers and knew the trick of emptying the last drop   the jorum was about his usual dose   about two minutes later  while dick and tom tripe between them held a horse in intolerable durance between the shafts  and tom s horse out of sympathy kicked out at random into every shadow he could reach  the door and part of the wall of tom s shed fell outward into the pitch dark street as akbar  eleven feet four inches at the shoulder  strode forward conjecturing what worlds were yet to conquer   the other elephants stood motionless at their pickets   a terrified mahout emerged through the debris like a devil from bell s bunkers  calling to his elephant all the endearing epithets he knew  and cursing him alternately   the horses grew calmer and submitted to caresses  like children and all creatures that have intimate contact with strong men   and presently the night grew still    d you suppose that brute swiped my liquor   wondered tom tripe           you mind the horses while i look    but suddenly there was a savage noise of trumpeting up street  followed by a bark and a yelp of canine terror    god   swore tom    that s trotters coming to fetch us   akbar s chasing him back this way   hang on to the horse like ten men   i ll go see    he was outside before dick could remonstrate   between them they had lashed the dog cart wheels during the first panic  but even so dick had his hands full  as the trumpeting drew nearer and the horse went into agonies of senseless fear   it was a fight  nothing less  between thinking man and mere instinctive beast  and eventually dick threw him with a trick of the reins about his legs  and knelt on his head to keep him down   by the grace of the powers of unexpectedness neither shafts nor harness broke   outside in the darkness tom tripe peered through brandied eyes at a great shadow that hunted to and fro a hundred yards away  chasing something that was quite invisible  and making enough noise about it to awake the dead    trotters   he yelled   trotters    a moment later a smaller shadow came into view at top speed  panting  chased hotly by the bigger one    trotters   get back where you came from   back  d ye hear me   back    within ten yards of his master the dog stopped to do his thinking  and the elephant screamed with a sort of hunter s ecstasy as he closed on him with a rush   but thought is swift  and obedience good judgment  the dog doubled of a sudden between akbar s legs and the elephant slid on his rump in the futile effort to turn after him  then crashed into the wall opposite tripe s dismantled shed  cannoned off it with a grunt of sheer disgust  and set off up street  once more in hot pursuit            that brute got my good rum  damn him   said tom  opening the stable door    hello   horse down   any harm done   right oh  we ll soon have him up again   better hurry now  trotters came for us        chapter nine     so many look at the color  so many study design  some of  em squint through a microscope to judge if the texture is fine  a few give a thought to the price of the stuff  some feel of the heft in the hand  but once in a while there is one who can smile and  appraising the lot  understand  look out  when the seemingly sold understand  all s planned  for the cook of the stew to be canned out o  hand  when the due to be choused understand     it means  the toils are closing in on gungadhura    within the palace tess was reveling in vaudeville in the first place  yasmini had no western views on modesty   whatever her mother may have taught her in that respect had gone the way of all the other handicaps she saw fit to throw into the discard  or to retain for use solely when she saw there was advantage   the east uses dress for ornament  and understands its use   the veil is for places where men might look with too bold eyes and covet   out of sight of privileged men prudery has no place  and almost no advocates all the way from peshawar to cape comorin   and yasmini had loved dancing since the days when she tottered her first steps for her mother s and bubru singh s delight   long before an american converted the russian royal ballet  and the russian royal ballet in return took all the theatre going west by storm  scandalizing   then amazing  then educating bit by bit  yasmini had developed her own ideas and brought them by arduous practise to something near perfection   to that her strength  agility and sinuous grace were largely due   and she practised no deceptions on herself  but valued all three qualities for their effect on other people  keeping no light under a bushel   the consciousness of that night s climactic quality raised her spirits to the point where they were irrepressible  and she danced her garments off one by one  using each in turn as a foil for her art until there was nothing left with which to multiply rhythm and she danced before the long french mirrors yet more gracefully with nothing on at all   getting tess disrobed was a different matter   she did not own to much prudery  but the maids  eyes were over curious   and  lacking  as she knew she did  yasmini s ability to justify nakedness by poetry of motion  she hid behind a curtain and was royally laughed at for her pains   but she was satisfied to retain that intangible element that is best named dignity  and let the laughter pass unchallenged   yasmini  with her eastern heritage  could be dignified as well as beautiful as nature made her  not so tess  or at any rate she thought not  and what one thinks is after all the only gage acceptable   then came the gorgeous fun of putting on tess s clothes  each to be danced in as its turn came  and made fun of  so that tess herself began to believe all western clothes were awkward  idiotic things  until yasmini stood clothed complete at last  with her golden hair all coiled under a paris hat  and looked as lovely that way as any   the two women were almost exactly the same size   even the shoes fitted  and when yasmini walked the length of the room with tess s very stride and attitude tess got her first genuine glimpse of herself as another s capably critical eyes saw her  a priceless experience  and not so humiliating after all   they dressed up tess in man s clothes  a young rajput s  a suit yasmini had worn on one of her wild excursions  and what with the coiled turban of yellow silk and a little black mustache adjusted by cunning fingers she felt as happy as a child in fancy dress   but she found it more difficult to imitate the rajput walk than yasmini did to copy her tricks of carriage  for a few minutes they played at walking together up and down the room before the mirror  applauded by the giggling maids   but then suddenly came anti climax   there was a great hammering at the outer door  and one of the maids ran down to investigate  while they waited in breathless silence   the news the maid brought back was the worst imaginable   the look out at the northern corner of the wall  yasmini kept watch on her captors as rigorously as they spied on her  had run with the word to the gateman that gungadhura himself was coming with three eunuchs  all four on foot   almost as soon as the breathless girl could break that evil tidings there came another hammering  and this time hasamurti went down to answer  her news was worse   gungadhura was at the outer gate demanding admission  and threatening to order the guard to break the gate in if refused    what harm can he do   demanded tess    he won t dare try any violence in front of me   let us change clothes again    yasmini laughed at her    a prince on a horse may ride from harm   she answered    when princes walk  let other folk  ware trouble   he comes to have his will on me  those eunuchs are the leash that always hunt with him by night   they will manhandle you  too  if they once get in  and gungadhura will take his chance of trouble afterward   the guard dare not refuse him     what shall we do   tess wondered    can we hide    then  pulling herself together for the sake of her race and her western womanhood   if we make noise enough at the gate my husband will come   we re all right     if there are any gods at all   said yasmini piously   they will consider our plight   i think this is a vengeance on me because i said i will leave my maids behind   i will not leave them   hasamurti  you and the others make ready for the street    that was a simple matter   in three minutes all five women were back in the room  veiled from head to foot   but the hammering at the front door was repeated  louder than before   tess wondered whether to hope that the risaldar of the guard had already reported to gungadhura the lady doctor s visit  or to hope that he had not    we will all go down together now   yasmini decided  and promptly she started to lead the way alone   but hasamurti sprang to her side  and insisted with tears on disguising herself as her mistress and staying behind to provide one slim chance for the rest to escape    in the dark you will pass for the memsahib   she urged    the memsahib will pass for a man   wait by the gate until the maharajah enters  while i stand at the door under the lamp as a decoy   i will run into the house  and he will follow with the eunuchs  while the rest of you slip out through the gate  and run before the guard can close it   perhaps one  at least  of the other maids had better stay with me    a second maid volunteered  but yasmini would have none of that plan  first and last the great outstanding difference between her and the ordinary run of conspirators  western or eastern  was unwillingness to sacrifice faithful friends even in a pinch  although she could be ruthlessness itself toward half hearted ones   both those habits grew on her as she grew older   by the time they reached the little curtained outer hall the maids were on the verge of hysteria   tess had herself well in control  and was praying busily that her husband might only be near enough to hear the racket at the gate   she was willing to be satisfied with that  and to ask no further favors of providence  unless that dick should have tom tripe with him  outwardly calm enough  she could not for the life of her remember to stride like a man   yasmini turned more than once to rally her about it   yasmini herself looked unaccountably meek in the western dress  but her blue eyes blazed with fury and she walked with confidence  issuing her orders in a level voice   the gateman had come to the door again to announce that gungadhura had issued a final warning   two more minutes and the outer gate should be burst in by his orders    tell the maharajah sahib that i come in person to welcome him   she retorted  and the gateman hurried back into the dark toward his post   there were no lights at the outer gate   one could only guess how the stage was set  the maharajah hooded lest some enemy recognize him   the eunuchs behind him with cords concealed under their loose outer garments  and the guard at a respectful distance standing at attention  there was not a maharajah s sepoy in sialpore who would have dared remonstrate with gungadhura in dark or daylight   only as they passed under the yellow light shed by the solitary lantern on the iron bracket did tess get an inkling of yasmini s plan   light glinted on the wrought hilt of a long italian dagger  and her smile was cold  uncompromising  shuddersome   tess objected instantly    didn t you promise you d kill nobody   if we d a pistol we could fire it in the air and my husband would come in a minute     how do we know that gungadhura hasn t killed your husband  or shut him up somewhere    yasmini answered  and tess had an attack of cold chills that rendered her speechless for a moment   she threw it off with a prodigious effort    but i ve no weapon of any kind  and you can t kill gungadhura  three eunuchs and the guard as well   she argued presently    wait and see what i will do   was the only answer    gungadhura caused my pistols to be stolen   but the darkness is our friend  and i think the gods  if there are any gods  are going to assist us    they walked to the gate in a little close packed group  and found the gateman stuttering through the small square hole provided for interviews with strangers  telling the maharajah for the third or fourth time that the princess herself was coming   gungadhura s voice was plainly audible  growling threats from the outer darkness    stand aside   yasmini ordered    i will attend to the talking now    she went close to the square hole  but was careful to keep her face in shadow at the left hand side of it    what can his highness  gungadhura singh  want with his relative at this strange hour   she asked    open the gate   came the answer   he was very close to it  ready to push with his shoulder the instant the bolt was drawn  for black passion had him in hand   but in the darkness he was as invisible as she was    nay  how shall i know it is gungadhura singh     ask the guard   ho  there   tell her who it is demands admission     nay  they might lie to me   the voice sounds strange   i would open for gungadhura singh   but i must be sure it is he and no other     look then   he answered  and thrust his dark face close to the opening   even the utterly base have intuition   nothing else warned him   in the very nick of time he stepped back  and yasmini s long dagger that shot forward like a stab of lightning only cut the cheek beneath the eye  and slit it to the corner of his mouth   the blood poured down into his beard and added fury to determination    guards  break in the gate   he shouted  and yasmini stood back in the darkest shadow  about as dangerous as a cobra guarding young ones  with her left hand she signed to all six women to hide themselves  but tess came and stood beside her  minded in that minute to give gungadhura western aftermath to reckon with as well as the combined present courage of two women   wondering desperately what she could do to help against armed men she suddenly snatched one of the long hat pins that she herself had adjusted in her own hat on yasmini s head   yasmini hugged her close and kissed her    better than sister   better than friend   she whispered   gungadhura had not been idle while he waited for his message to reach yasmini  but had sent some of the guard to find a baulk of timber for a battering ram   the butts of rifles would have been useless against that stout iron   the gate shook now under the weight of the first assault  but the guards were handling the timber clumsily  not using their strength together  gungadhura cursed them  and spent two valuable minutes trying to show them how the trick should be worked  the blood that poured into his beard  and made of his mouth a sputtering crimson mess  not helping to make his raging orders any more intelligible   presently the second crash came  stronger and more elastic than the first   the iron bent inward  and it was plainly only a matter of minutes before the bolt would go   the gateman came creeping to yasmini s side  and  with yellow fangs showing in a grin meant to be affectionate  displayed an afghan tulwar    ismail   she said    i thought you were afraid and ran to hide     nay   he answered    my life is thine  princess   gungadhura took away all weapons  but this i hid   i went to find it   see   he grinned  feeling the edge with his thumb   it is clean   it is keen   it will cut throats     i will not forget   yasmini answered  but the words were lost in the din of the third blow of wood on iron   the odds began not to look so bad  two desperate women and a faithful northern fighting man armed with a weapon that he loved and understood  against a wounded blackguard and three eunuchs   perhaps the guard might look on and not interfere   there was a chance to make a battle royal of it  whose tumult would bring dick blaine and tom tripe to the rescue   what was the dog doing   tess wondered whether any animal could be so intelligent after all as tom pretended his was   perhaps the maharajah had seen the dog and killed him    listen   she urged    tell your maids to stampede for the street the instant the door breaks in   that will give the guard their work to do to hold them   meanwhile      thump   came the timber on the gate again  and even the hinges shook in their stone setting    listen   said yasmini   there was another noise up street  a rushing to and fro  and a trumpeting that no one could mistake    i said that      thump   came the baulk of timber  not so powerfully as before   there was distraction affecting the team work   the scream of an elephant fighting mad  and the yelp of a dog  that pierces every other noise  rent the darkness close at hand    i said that the gods     there came the thud of a very heavy body colliding with a wall  and another blood curdling scream of rage  then the thunder of what might have been an avalanche as part of a near by wall collapsed  and a brute as big as leviathan approached at top speed   there was another thud  but this time caused by the hulk of timber falling on the ground  as guard  eunuchs and gungadhura all took to their heels    allah   il hamdul illah   swore the gateman    thanks be to god     i said that the gods would help tonight   yasmini cried exultantly    o lord  what has happened to dick   groaned tess between set teeth   the thunder of pursuit drew nearer   possessed by some instinct she never offered to explain  yasmini stepped to the gate  drew back the bolt  and opened it a matter of inches   in shot tom tripe s dog  with his tongue hanging out and the fear of devils blazing in his eyes   yasmini slammed the gate again in the very face of a raging elephant  and shot the bolt in the nick of time to take the shock of his impact   it was only a charge in half earnest or he would have brought the gate down   an elephant is a very short sighted beast  and it was pitch dark  he could not believe that a dog could disappear through a solid iron gate  and after testing the obstruction for a moment or two  grumbling to himself angrily  he stood to smell the air and listen   there was a noise farther along the street of a stampede of some kind   that was likely enough his quarry  probably frightening other undesirables along in front of him   with a scream of mingled frenzy and delight he went off at once full pelt    oh  trotters   good dog  trotters   sobbed tess  kneeling down to make much of him  and giving way to the reaction that overcomes men as well as women    where s your master   oh  if you could tell me where my husband is    she did not have long to wait for the answer to that   it took the two men a matter of seconds to get the horse on his feet  and no fire engine ever left the station house one fraction faster than dick tooled that dog cart  the horse was all nerves and in no mood to wait on ceremony  which accounted for a broken spoke and a fragment of the gate post hanging in the near wheel   they forgot to unlash the wheels before they started  so the dog cart came up street on skids  as it were  screaming holy murder on the granite flags  which in turn saved the near wheel from destruction   it also made it possible to rein in the terrified horse exactly in front of the palace gate   another proof that as yasmini said  the gods of india were in a mood to help that night    not that she ever believed the gods are one bit more consequential than men    yasmini drew the bolt  and the gate creaked open reluctantly   the shock of the elephant s shoulder had about ended its present stage of usefulness  tom tripe  dismounting from his horse in a hurry and throwing the reins over the dog cart lamp  was first to step through    where s my dog   he demanded    where s that trotters o  mine  did akbar get him    a cold nose thrust in his hand was the answer    oh  so there you are  you rascal   there  lie down    that was all the ceremonial that passed between them  but the dog seemed satisfied   tess was out through the gate almost sooner than tom tripe could enter it   they brushed each other s shoulders as they passed   up in the dog cart she and her husband laughed in each other s arms  each at the other s disguise  neither of them with the slightest notion what would happen next  except that dick knew the dog cart wheels would have to be unlashed    how many people will the carriage hold    yasmini called to them  appearing suddenly in the lamp light   and dick blaine began laughing all over again  for except for the golden hair she looked so like the wife who sat on his left hand  and his wife so like a rajput that the humor of the situation was its only obvious feature    i must not take my carriage  for they would trace it  and besides  there is too little time   can we all ride in your carriage   there are six of us     probably   but where to   dick answered    i will direct   ismail must come too  but he can run    it was an awful crowd  for the dog cart was built for four people at the most  and in the end tess insisted on riding behind tom tripe because she was dressed like a man and could do it easily   ismail was sent back to close the gate from the inside and clamber out over the top of it   there was just room for a lean and agile man to squeeze between the iron and the stone arch    let the watchmen who feared and hid themselves stay to give their own account to gungadhura   yasmini sneered scornfully    they are no longer men of mine     now  where away   demanded dick  giving the horse his head    to my house   you ll be safe there for the present     no   they might trace us there    yasmini was up beside him  wedged tightly between him and hasamurti  so like his own wife  except for a vague eastern scent she used  that he could not for the life of him speak to her as a stranger    listen   she said excitedly    i had horses here  there  everywhere in case of need   but gungadhura sent men and took them all   now i have only one horse  in your stable  i must get that tonight   first  then  drive my women to a place that i will show you    away in the distance they could hear the trumpeting of akbar  and the shouts of men who had been turned out to attempt the hopeless task of capturing the brute   at each scream the horse trembled in the shafts and had to be managed skillfully  but the load was too heavy now for him to run away with it    if that elephant will continue to be our friend and will only run the other way for a distraction  so that we are not seen  one of these days i will give him a golden howdah   vowed yasmini   and akbar did that very thing   whoever was awake that night in sialpore  and was daring enough to venture in the dark streets  followed the line of destruction and excitement  gloating over the broken property of enemies or awakening friends to make them miserable with condolences  the dog cart threaded through the streets unseen  for even the scarce night watchmen left their posts to take part in the hunt   yasmini guided them to the outskirts of the town in a line as nearly straight as the congenital deviousness of sialpore s ancient architects allowed  there was not a street but turned a dozen times to the mile   at one point she bade dick stop  and begged tess to let tom tripe take her home  promising to see her again within the hour   but tess had recovered her nerve and was determined to see the adventure through  in spite of the discomforts of a seat behind tom s military saddle   they brought up at last in front of a low dark house at the very edge of the city   it stood by itself in a compound  with fields behind it  and looked prosperous enough to belong to one of the maharajah s suite    the house of mukhum dass   yasmini announced    the money lender     yes    dick made a wry face  for the man s extortions were notorious   but yasmini never paused to cast up virtue when she needed assistants in a hurry   rather she was adept at appraising character and bending it to suit her ends   ismail  hot and out of breath from running at the cart tail  was sent to pound the money lender s door  until that frightened individual came down himself to inquire  with the door well held by a short chain  what the matter was    i lend no money in the night   was his form of greeting   he always used it when gamblers came to him in the heat of the loser s passion at unearthly hours  and sometimes ended by making a loan at very high interest on sound security   otherwise he would have stayed in bed  whatever the thunderous importunity   yasmini was down at the door by that time  and it was she who answered    nay  but men win lawsuits by gathering evidence   are title deeds not legal in the dark     who are you   he demanded  reaching backward for a little lamp that hung on the wall behind him and trying to see her face    i am the same who met you that morning on the hilltop and purchased silence from you at a price    he peered through the narrow opening  holding the lamp above his head    that was a man   you are a woman    for answer to that she stood on tiptoe and blew the lamp out   he would have slammed the door  but her foot was in the way    by dark or daylight  mukhum dass  your eyes read nothing but the names on hundis  notes    now  what does the car say   does the voice tell nothing     aye  it is the same     you shall have that title deed tomorrow at dawn  on certain terms     how do i know     because i say it  i  who said that chamu would repay his son s loan    i  who knew from the first all about the title deed   i  who know where it is this minute   i  who know the secrets of jinendra s priest   i  whose name stands written on the hundred rupee note with which the butler paid his son s debt     the princess   the princess yasmini   it was her name on the note     her name is mine    the money lender stood irresolutely  shifting his balance from foot to foot   it was his experience that when people with high born names came to him by night mysteriously there was always profit in it for himself  and then  there was that title deed   he had bought the house cheap  but its present value was five times what he gave for it   its loss would mean more to him than the loss of a wife to some men  as yasmini knew  and counted on    open the door and let me in  mukhum dass   the terms are these      nay  we can talk with the door between us     very well  then  lose thy title deed   dhulap singh  thine enemy  shall have it within the hour    she took her foot out from the door and turned away briskly   promptly he opened the door wide  and called after her    nay  come  we will discuss it     i discuss nothing   she answered with a laugh    i dictate terms     name them  then     i have here five women   they must stay in safety in your house until an hour before dawn     god forbid     until an hour before dawn  you hear me   if any come to inquire for them or me  you must deny any knowledge     that i would be sure enough to do   shall i have it said that mukhum dass keeps a dozen women in his dotage     an hour before dawn i will come for them     none too soon     then i will write a letter to a certain man  who  on presentation of the letter  will hand you the title deed at once without payment     a likely tale     was it a likely tale that chamu would repay his son s debt     well  i will take the hazard   bring them in   but i will not feed them  and if you fail to come for them before dawn i will turn them out and it shall be all over sialpore that the princess yasmini      one moment  mukhum dass   if one word of this escapes your lips for a month to come  you shall go to jail for receiving stolen money in payment of a debt   my name was on the money that chamu paid you with  you knew he stole it     i did not know     prove that in court  then     bring the women in   he grumbled    i am no cackler from the roofs    yasmini did not wait for him to change his mind but shepherded her scared dependents through the door  and called for ismail    did you see these women enter   she demanded    aye   i saw   have i not eyes     stay thou here outside and watch   afterward  remember  if i say nothing  be thou dumb as tom tripe s dog   but if i give the word  tell all sialpore that mukhum dass is a satyr who holds revels in his house by night  bring ten other men to swear to it with thee  until the very children of the streets shout it after him when he rides his rounds   hast thou understood   silence for silence   but talk for talk   hast thou heard  too  mukhum dass   good   shut thy door tight  but thy mouth yet tighter  and try rather to take liberties with hornets than with those five women    before he could answer she was gone  leaving ismail lurking in the shadows   tess had dismounted from behind tom tripe and climbed up beside her husband so that there were three on the front seat again    now  tom tripe   yasmini ordered  speaking with the voice of command that tom himself would have used to a subordinate    do you as the elephant did  and cause distraction   draw gungadhura off the scent     hell s bells  deary me  your ladyship   he answered    all the drawing i ll do after this night s work will be my last month s pay  and lucky if i see that   lordy knows what the guard ll tell the maharajah  nor what his rage ll add to it     nonsense   gungadhura and the guard ran from the elephant like dust before the wind   the guards are the better men  and will be back at their post before this   but gungadhura must find a discreet physician to bind a slit face for him   visit the guard now  and get their ear first  tell them gungadhura wants no talk about tonight s work   then come to blaine sahib s house and search the cellar by lamplight  letting chalmu the butler see you do it  but taking care not to let him see what you see  what you do see  leave where it lies   then see gungadhura early in the morning      lordy me  your ladyship  he ll      no  he won t   he ll want to know how much you know about his behavior at the gate   tell him you know everything  and that you ve compelled the guard to keep silence   that ought to reconcile the coward   but if he threatens you  then threaten him   threaten to go to samson sahib with the whole story    but if you do dare really go to samson sahib  never look me in the face again    then tell gungadhura that you searched the cellar  and what you saw there under a stone  adding that blaine sahib was suspicious  and watched you  and afterward sealed the cellar door   have you understood me     i understand there s precious little sleep for me tonight  and hell in the morning     pouf   are you a soldier     i m your ladyship s most thorough paced admirer and obedient slave   tom answered gallantly  his mutton chop whiskers fairly bristling with a grin    prove it  then  this night     as if i hadn t   well  all s well  your ladyship  i m on the job   crib  crupper and breakfast time  yours truly     when you have finished interviewing gungadhura  find for blaine sahib a new cook and a new butler  who can be trusted not to poison him     if i can     of course you can find them   tell sita ram  samson sahib s babu  what is wanted   he will find men in one hour who have too much honor  and too little brains  and too great fear to poison any one   say that i require it of him   have your understood   then go   go swiftly to the guard and stop their tongues    tom whistled his dog and rode off at a canter   dick gave the horse his head and drove home as fast as the steepness of the hill permitted  yasmini talking to him nearly all the way    you must dismiss chamu   she insisted    he is gungadhura s man  and the cook is under the heel of chamu   either man would poison his own mother for a day s pay   send them both about their business the first thing in the morning if you value your life   before they go  let them see you put a great lock on the cellar door  and nail it as well  and put weights on it   if men come at any time to pry about the house  ask samson sahib for a special policeman to guard the place     but what is all this leading to   demanded dick    what does it mean     it means   she said slowly   that the toils are closing in on gungadhura     the way i figure it   he answered   some one else had a pretty narrow shave tonight    yasmini knew better than to threaten dick  or even to argue with him vehemently  much less give him orders   but each man has a line of least resistance    your wife has told you what gungadhura attempted   she asked him    yes  while you were at the money lender s  something of it     if the guard should tell gungadhura that your wife was in the palace with me and could give evidence against him  what do you suppose gungadhura would do     damn him   dick murmured    there are so many ways  snakes  poison  daggers in the dark      what do you suggest   he asked her    leave sialpore     yes  but with me   i know a safe place   she should come with me     when     tonight   before dawn     how     by camel   i had horses and gungadhura took them all  but his brain was too sotted to think of camels  and i have camels waiting not many miles from here   i shall take my horse from your stable and ride for the camels  bringing them to the house of mukhum dass   let your wife meet me there one hour before dawn     dick   said tess  with her arm around him    i want to go   i know it sounds crazy  and absurd  and desperate   but i m sure it isn t   i want you to let me go with her    they reached the house before he answered  he  turning it over and over in his mind  taking into reckoning a thousand things    well   he said at last   once in a while there s the strength of a man about you  tess   maybe i m a lunatic  but have it your own way  girl  have it your own way        chapter ten     in odor of sweet sanctity i bloom  with surplus of beatitude i bless  i m the confidant of destiny and doom  i m the apogee of knowledge more or less  if i lie  it is to temporize with lying lest obliquity should suffer in the light  if i prey upon the widow and the dying  they withheld   and i compel them to do right  i am justified in all that i endeavor  if i fail it is because the rest are fools  i m serene and unimpeachable forever  the upheld  ordained interpreter of rules     discretion is better part of secrecy    some of what follows presently was told to yasmini afterward by sita ram  some of it by tom tripe  and a little by dick blaine  who had it from samson himself   the rest she pieced together from admissions by jinendra s fat priest and the gossip of some dancing girls   sir roland samson  k  c  s  i   as told already  was a very demon for swift office work  routine pouring off him into the hands of the right subordinates like water into the runnels of a roof  leaving him free to bask in the sunshine of self complacency   but there is work that can not be tackled  or even touched by subordinates   and  the fixed belief of envious inferiors to the contrary notwithstanding  there are hours unpaid for  unincluded in the office schedule  and wholly unadvertised that hold such people as commissioners in durance vile   on the night of yasmini s escape samson sat sweating in his private room  with moths of a hundred species irritating him by noisy self  immolation against the oil lamp whose smoke made matters worse by being sucked up at odd moments by the punkah  pulled jerkily by a new man   most aggravating circumstance of all  perhaps  was that the movement of the punkah flickered his papers away whenever he removed a weight   yet he could not study them unless he spread them all in front of him   and without the punkah he felt he would die of apoplexy   he had to reach a decision before midnight   babu sita ram was supposed to be sitting tinder a punkah in the next room  with a locked door between him and his master   he was staying late  by special request and as a special favor  to copy certain very important but not too secret documents in time for the courier next day  there were just as many insects to annoy him  and the punkah flapped his papers too   but fat though he was  and sweat though he did  his smile was the smile of a hunter   from time to time he paused from copying  stole silently to the door between the offices  gingerly removed a loose knot from a panel  and clapped to the hole first one  and then the other avidious brown eye   samson wished to goodness there was some one he dared consult with  there were other englishmen  of course  but they were all ambitious like himself   he felt that his prospects were at stake   news had reached the state department  by channels sita ram could have uncovered for him  that gungadhura was intriguing with tribes beyond the northwest frontier   the tribes were too far away to come in actual touch with sialpore  although they were probably too wild and childish to appreciate that fact  the point was that gungadhura was said to be promising them armed assistance from the british rear  assistance that he never would possibly be able to render them   and his almost certain intention was  when the rising should materialize  to offer his small forces to the british as an inexpensive means of quelling the disturbance  thus restoring his own lost credit and double crossing all concerned   a subtle motive  subtly suspected   it was no new thing in the annals of indian state affairs  nor anything to get afraid about   but what the state department desired to know was  why sir roland samson  k  c  s  i   was not keeping a closer eye on gungadhura  what did he propose as the least troublesome and quietest solution  and would he kindly answer by return   all that was bad enough  because a  beau ideal commissioner  rather naturally feels distressed when information of that sort goes over his head or under his feet to official superiors   but he could have got around it   it should not have been very difficult to write a report that would clear himself and give him time to turn around   but that very evening no less an individual than the high priest of jinendra had sent word by sita ram that he craved the favor of an interview    and   had added sita ram with malicious delight   it is about the treasure of sialpore and certain claims to it that i think he wants to see you     why should he come by night   demanded samson    because his errand is a secret one   announced the babu  with a hand on his stomach as if he had swallowed something exquisite   so samson was in a quandary  going over secret records getting ready for an issue with the priest   his report had to be ready by morning  yet he hardly dared begin it without knowing what the priest might have in mind   and on his own intricate knowledge of the situation might depend whether or not he could extract  from a man more subtle than himself  information on which to base sound proposals to his government   his reputation was decidedly at stake   and dangerous intrigue was in the air  or else the priest would never be coming to visit him   sita ram kept peeping at him through the knot hole  as a cook peers at a tit bit in the oven  to judge whether it is properly cooked yet   jinendra s priest had had time for reflection   true to his kidney  he trusted nobody  unlike yasmini who knew whom to trust  and when  and just how far   it was all over the city that gungadhura s practises were hastening his ruin  so it was obviously wise not to espouse the maharajah s cause  in addition to which he had become convinced in his own mind that yasmini actually knew the whereabouts of the sialpore treasure   but he did not trust yasmini either  nor did he relish her scornful promise of a mere percentage of the hoard when it should at last be found   he wanted at least the half of it  bargains to the contrary notwithstanding   and he had that comfortable conscience that has soothed so many priests  that argues how the church must be above all bargains  all bonds  all promises   was there any circumstance  or man  or woman who could bind and circumscribe jinendra s high priest   he laughed at the suggestion of it   samson was the man to see   samson the man to be inveigled in the nets   so he sent his verbal message by the mouth of sita ram  a very pious devotee of jinendra by yasmini s special orders   and  disguising his enormous bulk in a thin cloak  set forth long after dark in a covered cart drawn by two tiny bulls   there were two doors to sita ram s small office   two to samson s large one  three doors in all  because they shared the connecting one  that was locked just now  in common   at the first sound of the long  awaited heavy footsteps on the outer porch sita ram hurried to do the honors  and presently ushered into samson s presence the enormous bulk of the high priest  spreading a clean cloth for him on an easy chair because the priest s caste put it out of the question for him to sit on leather defiled by european trousers   then  while the customary salaams were taking place  and the customary questions about health and other matters that neither cared a fig about  sita ram ostentatiously drew a curtain part way over the connecting door  and retired by way of the other door and the passage to remove the knot from its hole   it was part of samson s pride  and one of his stoutest rungs in the ladder of preferment  that be knew more indian languages than any other man of his rank in the service  and knew them well   there were asterisks and stars and twiggly marks against his name in the blue book that would have passed muster as a secret code  and every one of them betokened passed examinations in some eastern tongue   so he was fully able to meet the high priest on his own ground  as well as conscious of the advantage he held to begin with  in that the priest had come to him instead of his going to the priest    well   he demanded  cutting the pleasantries short abruptly as soon as sita ram had closed the door    i came to speak of politics     i listen    samson leaned back and scrutinized his visitor with deliberate rudeness  having the upper hand he proposed to hold it   but jinendra s high priest was no beginner either in the game of beggar my neighbor   he understood the value of a big trump to begin with  provided there is other ammunition in reserve    the whereabouts of the treasure of sialpore is known     the deuce it is   said samson  in good plain english    who knows it   he demanded   the high priest smiled   samson  as was natural  felt that tingling up and down the spine and quickening of the heart beats that announces crisis in one s personal affairs  but concealed it admirably   it was the high priest s turn to speak  he waited    half of that treasure belongs to the priesthood of jinendra   said the priest at last    since when     since the beginning     why     we were keepers of the treasure once years ago  before the english came  there came a time when the reigning rajah deceived us by a trick  including murder   and ever since the english took control the priests have had less and less authority   there has been no chance to   to bring any  to put pressure  to reestablish our rights   nevertheless  our rights in the matter were never surrendered     what do you mean by that exactly     the english are now the real rulers of sialpore    samson nodded   that was a significant admission  coming from a brahman priest    they should claim the treasure   but they can not claim it without knowing where it is   the priests of jinendra are entitled to their half     you mean you are willing that my government should take half the treasure  provided the priests of jinendra get the other half of it    the priest moved his head and his lips in a way that might be taken to mean anything    if you know where the treasure is  dig it up   said samson   and you shall have your answer    yasmini in the heat of excitement had called samson an idiot  but he was far from being that  as she knew as well as any one   he judged in that moment that if jinendra s priest knew really where the treasure was  he would never have come to drive a bargain for the half of it  but would have taken all and said nothing   on the other hand  it well might be that gungadhura s searchers had stumbled on it   in that case  there was that secret letter from headquarters hurriedly placed in his top drawer when the priest came in  that would give good excuse for putting screws on gungadhura   a coup d etat was not beyond the pale of possibility   as a champion of indiscretion and a judge of circumstances  he would dare   the gleam in his eyes betrayed that he would dare  and the priest grew uneasy    it is not i who know where the treasure is   i know who knows     you mean gungadhura knows    the priest smiled again   the commissioner was not such a dangerous antagonist after all   samson s eyes betrayed disappointment  and the priest took heart of grace    for one half of the treasure i will tell you who it is that knows   you can take possession of the of the person   then      illegal   by what right could i arrest a person simply because some one else asserts without proof that that person knows where the treasure is     not arrest  perhaps   but you might protect     from whom   from what     gungadhura suspects   he might use poison  torture  might carry the person off into hiding     he paused  for samson s eyes were again a signal of excitement  he had it   he knew as much as the priest himself did in that instant  there was one particular individual in sialpore who fitted that bill    nonsense   he answered    gungadhura would be answerable to me for any outrages    the priest showed a slight trace of dejection  but went forward bravely to defeat    there is danger   he said    if gungadhura should lay hands on all that money  there would be no peace in rajputana   i should not bargain away what belongs to the priesthood  but discretion is permitted me  if you will agree with me tonight  i will accept a little less than half of it    samson wanted time to think  and he was through with the priest  finished with the interview   not even anxious to appear polite    if you bring me definite information   he said slowly   and on the strength of that my government should come in possession of the sialpore treasure  i will promise you in writing five per cent  of it for the funds of the priesthood of jinendra  the money to be held in trust and administered subject to accounting    jinendra s high priest hove his bulk out of the leather chair and went through the form of taking leave  contenting himself  too  with the veriest shell of courtesy  scorn for such an offer scowling from his fat face  samson showed him to the door and closed it after him  leaving babu sita ram to do the honors outside in the passage    i kiss feet   said the babu    you must bless me  father   i kiss feet    the priest blessed him perfunctorily    is there anything i can do  holy one   anything a babu such as i can do to earn merit    rolling on his ponderous way toward the waiting bull cart  the priest paused a moment  eyed sita ram as a python eyes a meal  and answered him    tell that woman from me that if she has a plan at all she must unfold it swiftly   tell her that this samson sahib is after the treasure for himself  that he invited me to help him and to share it with him   let her have word with me swiftly     what treasure   asked sita ram ingenuously   having had his ear to the knot hole throughout the interview  it suited him to establish innocence  the priest could have struck himself for the mistake  and sita ram  too  for the impudence    never mind   he answered    tell her what i say   those who obey and ask no unwise questions oftentimes receive rewards    inside the office samson sat elated  wiping his forehead and setting blotter over writing paper lest sweat from his wrists make the ink run  it was a bender of a night  but he saw his way to a brilliant stroke of statecraft that would land him on the heights of official approval forever  heat did not matter   the man at the punkah had fallen asleep  but he did not bother to waken him   back at the knot hole  babu sita ram watched him scribble half a dozen letters  tearing each up in turn until the last one pleased him   finally he sealed a letter  and directed it by simply writing two small letters  r  s   in the bottom left hand corner    sita ram   he shouted then   the babu let him call three times  for evidence of how hard it was to hear through that thick door   when he came it was round by the other way in a hurry    you called  sir     you need not copy any more of those documents tonight  sita ram  i shall send a telegram in the morning and keep my report in hand for a day or two   but there s one more little favor i would like to ask of you     anything  sahib   anything   am only desirous to please your excellency     do you know a man named tripe  tom tripe  drill instructor to the maharajah s guard     yes  sahib     could you find him  do you think     tonight  sahib     yes  tonight     sahib  he is usually drunk at night  and very rough   nevertheless  i could find him     please do   and give him this letter   say it is from me   he will know what to do with it   oh  and sita ram      yes  sahib     you will receive two days  extra pay from me  over and above your salary  for tonight s extra work     thank you  sahib   you are most kind  always most generous     and  ah  sita ram      sahib     say nothing  will you   by nothing i mean nothing   hold your tongue  eh     certainly  sahib   aware of the honor of my confidential position  i am always most discreet     what are you doing with that waste basket     taking it outside  sahib     the sweeper will do that in the morning     am always discreet  sahib   discretion is better part of secrecy   better to burn all torn up paper before daylight always     very good   you re quite right   thank you  sita ram   yes  burn the torn paper  please    so sita ram  piecing together little bits of paper got a very good idea of what was in the letter that he carried   the bonfire in the road looked beautiful and gladdened his esthetic soul  but the secret information thrilled him  which was better   he crossed the river  and very late that night he found tom tripe  as sober as a judge  what with riding back and forth to the blaines  house and searching in a cellar and what not  he gave him the letter  and received a rupee because tom s dog frightened him nearly out of his wits   tom swore at the letter fervently  but that was tom s affair  who could not guess the contents   almost exactly at dawn sita ram  as sleepy as a homing owl  reached his own small quarters in the densest part of town   he had his hand on the door when another hand restrained him from behind    you know me   said a voice he did not know   a moment later his terrified eyes informed him    mukhum dass   i owe you nothing     liar   you have my title deed   hand it over before i bring the constabeel     i   your title deed   i know nothing of it   what title deed    mukhum dass cut expostulation short  and denied himself the pleasure of further threatening    see   here is a letter   read it  and then hand me over my title deed     ah   that is different   said sita ram  pocketing yasmini s letter  for precaution s sake    wait here while i bring it    two minutes later he returned with a parchment in a tin tube    do i receive no recompense   he asked    did i not find the title deed and keep it safe   where is the reward     recompense   growled mukhum dass    to be out of jail is recompense  the next time you find property of mine  bring it to me  or the constabeel shall have work to do     dog   snarled the babu after him    dog of a usurer   wait and see        chapter eleven     to cover a trail is less than half the work  for any dog with a nose can smell it out   you should make a false trail afterward to deceive the clever folk    eastern proverb   say  that little girl you re wanting to run off with is my wife    the other side to the intrigue developed furiously up at the baines  house on the hillside   yasmini gave directions from tess s bedroom  where tess hid her from prying servants  she electing to change clothes once more  this time into her hostess  riding breeches  boots and helmet  but she insisted on tess retaining the rajput costume  only allowing a hand bag to be packed with woman s things  skirt  blouse and so on    if i am seen there must be no mistake about me   they must swear that i am you   it doesn t matter who they believe that you are   above all  chamu the butler must not see me   when he is dismissed in the morning he will tell tales for very spite  and take his chance of my accusing him of theft   so be sure that he sees tom tripe search the cellar  then he will confirm to the maharajah afterward that tripe did search   and did see something  and that blaine sahib did lock the cellar door afterward in anger  and put weights on it   that is the important thing  blaine sahib must drive the carriage again to the house of mukhum dass  and be sure that i am not kept waiting there  we must start before the dawn breaks   now give me paper and a pen to write the chit  letter  for mukhum dass    there was no ink in the bedroom   dick took her into the place he called his study  and locked the door  glad of the excuse   he was minded to know more of the intrigue before letting his wife go off again that night on any wild adventure  second thoughts having stirred his caution  he began by offering to lend her money  suspecting that a fugitive princess would need that more than anything   but she replied by drawing out from her bosom a packet containing thousands of rupees in bank of india notes  and gave him money instead  not much  but she forced it on him    for the three beggars   ten rupees each   pay it them in silver in the morning   they have been very useful often  and may be so again    he watched her write the letter and seal the envelope   then    say   he said   don t you think you d be doing right by telling me more of this   i ll say nothing to a soul  but that little girl you re wanting to run off with is my wife  and i ll admit i m kind o  concerned on her account    yasmini met his iron gray eyes  judged him and found him good    i never trusted man yet  not even the husband i shall marry  with all i shall tell you   she answered    will you give me silence in return for it     mum as the grave   he answered   and dick blaine kept his word  not even hinting to tess on the long drive afterward that there had been as much as a question asked or confidence exchanged   and tess respected the silence  not deceived for a minute by it   he and yasmini had been longer in that room together than any one page letter needed  and she was sure there was only one subject they discussed   dick brought yasmini s horse to the gate  not to the door  and she mounted outside in the road for additional precaution   instantly  then  without a word of farewell she was off like the wind down hill    it ll be all over town tomorrow that i m dead or dying  if anybody sees her   dick told his wife    they ll swear that was you  tess  riding full pelt for the doctor    soon after that tom tripe came  and made chamu hold a light for him while he searched the cellar    hold the candle and your tongue too  confound you   he told the grumbling butler  indignant at being brought from bed   dick had already put the silver tube in place   tom tripe raised the stone and saw it  uttered a tremendous oath  and dropped the heavy stone back over the hole    what are you doing   dick demanded from the ladder head  appearing with a lantern from behind the raised trap    looking for rum   tom answered   then he turned on chamu    did you see what i saw   speak a word of it  you devil  and i ll tear your throat out   silence  d you understand     come out of there   dick ordered angrily    i ll have to lock this cellar door   i can t have people prospecting down there   i ve got reasons of my own for keeping that cellar undisturbed   i m surprised at you  tom tripe  taking advantage of me when my back s turned    the minute they were up he put a padlock on the trap  and nailed it down to the beams as well   then  summoning tom s aid  he levered and shoved into place on top of it the heavy iron safe in which he kept his specimens and money    that ll do for you  chamu   he said finally    i don t care to keep a butler who takes guests into the cellar at this hour of night   you may go   i ll give you your time in the morning    chamu showed his teeth  by no means for the first time   it was a favorite method of his for covering up bad service to fall back on his reference    maharajah sahib who is recommending me will not be pleased at my dismissal     you and your maharajah go to hell together   dick retorted    tell him from me that i won t have inquisitive people in my cellar   now go  there s nothing more to talk about   fire the cook  too  as soon as he wakes   tell him i don t like ground glass in my omelette   not been any in it   well  what do i care   i don t want any in it  that s enough  i m taking no chances   tell him he s fired  and you two pull your freight together in the morning first thing    ten minutes alone with yasmini had worked wonders with dick blaine  given to making up his mind and seeing resolution through to stern conclusions  he was her stout ally from the moment when he unlocked the study door again until the end  a good silent ally too busy  apparently  about his own affairs to be suspected   certainly samson never suspected his real share in the intrigue  samson  the judge of circumstances  indiscretions  men and opportunity   he sent tom tripe packing  with a flea in his ear for chamu s benefit  and a whispered word of friendship   later he drove tess down hill in the dog cart  first changing his own disguise for american clothes because the saises might be up and about when he returned at dawn  and for them to see him in the costume of a sais would only have added to the risk of putting gungadhura s men on the scent of yasmini  saises are almost the most prolific source of rumor  but he had a means of stilling their tongues   there was little to say during the dark drive   they were affectionate  those two  without too many words when it came to leave taking  each knowing the other s undivided love   tess had money  a revolver   cartridges  some food  sufficient change of clothing for a week   sun spectacles   he reassured himself twice on all those points    if you re camel sick  fetch it up and carry  on   he advised   it ll soon pass   then a hot bath  if you can get it  before you stiffen   failing that  oil    the camels  with yasmini and her women already mounted  were kneeling in the darkness outside the house of mukhum dass    come   called yasmini    hurry    dick kissed his wife  waved his hand to yasmini  helped tess on to the last camel in the kneeling line  and they were off  the camel men not needing to shout to make those bikaniri racers rise and start   they were gone like ghosts into the darkness  making absolutely no noise  before dick could steady his nervous horse   then ismail wanted to tie yasmini s abandoned horse to the tail of the dog cart  but dick sent him off to stable it somewhere at the other side of town to help throw trackers off the scent   he himself drove home by a very wide circuit indeed  threading his cautious way among the hills toward the gold diggings  where he drove back and forward several times around the edges of the dump  in order that the saises might see the red dirt on the wheels afterward and believe  and tell where he had been   there was some risk that a panther  or even a tiger might try for the horse in the dark  but that was not the kind of danger that disturbed dick blaine much   a pistol at point blank range is as good as a rifle most nights of the week   he arrived home after daylight with a very weary horse  and ordered the saises to wash the wheels at once  in order that the color of the dirt might be impressed on them thoroughly  they were quite sure he had been at the mine all night   then he paid off chamu and the cook and sent them packing   he was looking for the beggars  to pay them  when tom tripe s dog arrived and began hunting high and low for tess   trotters had something in his mouth  wrapped in cloth and then again in leather   he refused to give it to dick  defying threats and persuasion both   dick offered him food  but the dog had apparently eaten  water  but he would not drink   then the three beggars came  and watched dick s efforts with the interest of spectators at a play    messenge   said bimbu finally  nodding at the dog   that much was pretty obvious    princess   he added  seeing dick was still puzzled   it flashed across dick s mind that on the dresser in the bedroom was tess s hat that yasmini had worn   doubtless to a dog s keen nose it smelt of both of them   he ran to fetch it  the dog followed him  eager to get into the house   he offered the hat to the dog  who sniffed it and yelped eagerly    bang goes fifty dollars  then   he laughed   he took the hat to bimbu    can you ride a camel   he demanded   the man nodded    another would drive it     do you know where to get one    bimbu nodded again    take this hat  so that the dog will follow you  and ride by camel to the home of utirupa singh   here is money for the camel  if you overtake the princess there will be a fabulous reward   if you get there soon after she does there will be a good reward   if you take too long on the way there will be nothing for you but a beating   go  hurry  get a move on   and don t you lose the dog        chapter twelve     there are they who yet remember  when the depot s forty jaws through iron teeth that chatter to the tramping of a throng spew out the crushed commuter in obedience to laws that all accord observance and that all agree are wrong  when rush and din and hubbub stir the too responsive vein till head and heart are conquered by the hustle roaring by and the sign looks good that glitters on the temple gate of gain     there are spaces just as luring where the leagues untrodden lie    there are they who yet remember  mid the fever of exchange  when the hot excitement throttles and the millions make or break  how a camel s silent footfall on the ashen desert range swings cushioned into distances where thoughts unfettered wake  and the memory unbidden plucks an unconverted heart till the glamour goes from houses and emotion from the street  and the truth glares good and gainly in the face of  change and mart   there are deserts more intensive   there are silences as sweet      ready for anything  if i weaken  tie me on the camel    there are camels and camels  more kinds than there are of horses  the bishareen of the sudan is not a bad beast  but compared to the bikaniri there are no other desert mounts worth a moment s consideration  fleet as the wind  silent as its own shadow  enduring as the long hot  season of its home  the trained bikaniri swings into sandy distances with a gait that is a gallop really  the only saddle beast of all that lifts his four feet from the ground at once  seeming to spurn the very laws of gravity   they are favored folk who come by first class bikaniri camels  for the better sort are rare  hard held to  and only to be bought up patiently by twos and ones   fourteen of them in one string  each fit that instant for a distance race with death itself  was perhaps the best proof possible of yasmini s influence on the country side   they were gathered for her and held in readiness by men who loved her and detested gungadhura   normally the drivers would have taken a passenger apiece  and seven of the animals would have been ample   but this was a night and a dawn when speed was nine tenths of the problem  and yasmini had spared nothing  no man  no shred of pains or influence   and proposed to spare no beast   they rode in single file  each man with a led camel ridden by a woman  except that yasmini directed her own mount and for the most part showed the way  her desert reared guide being hard put to keep his own animal abreast of her   there is a gift  a trick of riding camels  very seldom learned by the city born   and he  or she  who knows the way of it enjoys the ungrudged esteem of desert men all the way from china to damascus  from peshawar to morocco   the camels detect a skilled hand even more swiftly than a horse does and  like the horse  do their best work for the rider who understands   so the only sound  except for a gurgle now and then  and velvet silent footfalls on the level sand  was the grunts of admiration of the men behind   they had muffled all the camel bells   when they started the night was deepest purple  set densely with a mass of colored jewels   even the whitest of the stars stole color from the rest   but gradually  as they raced toward the sky line and the stars paled  the sky changed into mauve   then without warning a belt of pale gold shone in the west behind them  and with the false dawn came the cool wind like a legacy from the kindly night gods to encourage humans to endure the day   a little later than the wind the true dawn came  fiery with hot promise  and tess on the last camel soon learned the meaning of the cloak yasmini had made her wear   worn properly it covers all the face except the eyes  leaving no surface for the hot wind to torture  and saving the lips and lungs from being scorched   in after years  when yasmini was intriguing for an empire that in her imagination should control the world  she had the telegraph and telephone at times to aid her  as well as the organized  intricate system of british government to manipulate from behind the scenes   but now she was racing against the wires  and in no mood to appeal for help to a government that she did not quite understand as yet  but intended to foot royally in any case   the easiest thing gungadhura could do  and surest thing he would attempt once word should reach him that she had vanished from sialpore would be to draw around her a network of his own men   watchers from the hills and lurkers in the sand dunes could pass word along of the direction she had taken   and the sequel  if gungadhura was only quick enough  would depend simply on the loneliness or otherwise of the spot where she could be brought to bay   if there were no witnesses his problem would be simple   but if murder seemed too dangerous  there was the nesting place of seven swans up in the mountains  as well as other places even lonelier  to which she and tess could be abducted   tess might be left  perhaps  to make her own way back and give her own explanation of flight with a maharajah s daughter   but for yasmini abduction to the hills could only mean one of two things   unthinkable surrender  or sure death by any of a hundred secret means   so the way they took was wild and lonely  frequented only by the little jackals that eat they alone know what  and watched by unenthusiastic kites that always seemed to be wheeling in air just one last time before flying to more profitable feeding ground   yet within a thousand paces of the line they took lay a trodden track  well marked by the sun dried bones of camels  for the camel dies whenever he feels like it  without explanation or regret  and lies down for the purpose in the first uncomfortable place to hand    yasmini and the guide between them  first one  then the other assuming the direction  led the way around low hills and behind the long  blown folds of sand netted scantly down by tufted  dry grass  always avoiding open spaces where they might be seen  or hollows too nearly shut in on both sides  where there might be ambush   twice they were seen before the sun was two hours high  the first time by a caravan of merchants headed toward sialpore  who breasted a high dune half a mile away and took no notice   but that would not prevent the whole caravansary in the city s midst from knowing what they had seen  and just how long ago  and headed which way  within ten minutes after they arrived  as  in fact  exactly happened   the second party to catch sight of them consisted of four men on camels  whose rifles  worn military fashion with a sling  betrayed them as gungadhura s men    desert police  he called them    takers of tenths  was the popular  and much more accurate description   the four gave chase  for a caravan in a hurry is always likely to pay well for exemption from delay   and coming nearly at right angles they had all the advantage  it was crime to refuse to halt for them   for they were semi military  uniformed police   yet their invariable habit of prying into everything and questioning each member of a caravan would be certain to lead to discovery   they had a signal station on the hill two miles behind them  to keep them in touch with other parties  north  south  east and west  it looked like yasmini s undoing  for they were gaining two for one along the shorter course   tess fingered the pistol her husband had made her bring  wondering whether yasmini would dare show fight  not guessing yet the limitless abundance of her daring   and wondering whether she herself would dare reply to the fire of authorized policemen  she did not relish the thought of being an outlaw with a genuine excuse for her arrest   but the four police were oversure  and yasmini too quick witted for them  they took a short cut down into a sandy hollow  letting their quarry get out of sight  plainly intending to wait on rising ground about a thousand yards ahead  where they could foil attempts to circumvent them and  for the present  take matters easy   instantly yasmini changed direction  swinging her camel to the right  down a deep nullah  and leading full pelt at right angles to her real course  it was ten minutes before the men caught sight of them again  and by that time they had nearly drawn abreast  well beyond reasonable rifle range  and were heading back toward their old direction  so that the police had lost advantage  and a stern chase on slower camels was their only hope but one   they fired half a dozen shots by way of calling attention to themselves  then wheeled and raced away toward the signal station on the hill   yasmini held her course for an hour after that  until a spur of the hillside and another long fold of the desert shut them off from the signaler s view  there she called a halt  unexpectedly  for the camels did not need it  she was worried about tess  the one untested link in her chain of fugitives    can you keep on through all the hot day   she asked   these other women are as lithe as leopards  for i make them dance   they are better able to endure than cheetahs   but you   shall i put two women on one camel  and send you back to sialpore with two men    tess s back ached and she was dizzy  but her own powers had been tested many a time   this was not more than double the strain she had withstood before  and she was aware of strength in reserve  to say nothing of conviction that what yasmini s maids could do she herself would rather perish than fall short of   there is an element of sheer  pugnacious  unchristian human pride that is said to damn  while it saves the best of us at times    certainly not   i can carry on all day   she answered   yasmini emitted her golden bell like laugh that expressed such immeasurable understanding and delight in all she understands    it has overtones that tell of vision beyond the ken of folk who build on mud     the maids shall knead your muscles for you at the other end   she answered    courage is good   you are my sister   you shall see things that the west knows nothing of   if those thrice misbegotten takers of tenths had not seen us  we would have reached our goal a little after midday   as it is  they have certainly signaled to another party of gungadhura s spawn somewhere ahead of us  who will be coming this way with eyes open and a lesson in mind for those who disregard their comrades  challenge to halt and be looted   when i am maharanee  there shall be a new system of protecting desert roads   but i dare not try conclusions now   we must take a wide circuit and not reach our destination until night falls   are you willing     ready for anything   said tess    if i weaken  tie me on the camel     good   so speaks a woman   one woman of spirit is the master of a dozen men  always   they all drank sparingly of tepid water  ate a little of the food each had  and were off again without letting the camels kneel  heading now away from the hills toward a dazzling waste of silver sand  across which the eyes lost all sense of perspective  and all power to separate three objects in a row   a land of mirage and monotony  glittering in places with the aching white of salt deposits   the heat increased  but the speed never slackened for an instant   flies emerged from everywhere to fasten on to unprotected skin  and the only relief from them was under the hot cloaks that burned them with the heat absorbed from sun and wind   but even in that ghastly wilderness there were other living things   now and then a lean leopard stole away from in front of them   and once they saw a man  naked and thinner than a rake  striding along a ridge on heaven knew what errand   there were scorpions everywhere   hour after hour  guided by desert instinct that needs no compass  and ever alert for sky line watchers  yasmini and the headman took turns in giving direction  he yielding to her whenever their judgment differed  and whether she was right or not in every instance  she brought them at last to a little desert oasis  where there was brackish water deep down in a sand hole  and a great rock offered shadow to rest in   there they lay until the sun declined far enough to lose a little of his power to scorch  and the camels bubbled to one another  thirstless  unwearied  dissatisfied  as the universal way of camels is  kneeling in a circle  rumps outward  each one resentful of the other s neighborhood and  above all  disgruntled at man s tyranny    by now   laughed yasmini  smoking one of tess s cigarettes in the shadow of the rock   gungadhura knows surely that my palace is empty and the bird has flown   ten dozen different people will have carried to him as many accounts of it  and each will have offered different explanation and advice   i wonder what jinendra s fat priest has to say about it   gungadhura will have sent for him   he would hardly ride to the priest through the streets  even in a carriage  with that love token still raw and smarting with which i marked his face   two reliable reports will have reached him already as to which direction i have taken   yet the telegraph will have told him that i have not been seen to cross the border  and he will be wondering  wondering   may he wonder until his brains whirl round and sicken him     what can he do   suggested tess    do   he can be spiteful   he will enter my palace and remove the furniture  taking my mother s legacies to his own lair  where i shall recover them all within three weeks  and his own beside   i will be maharanee within the month     aren t you a wee bit previous   suggested tess    not i   i never boast   my mother taught me that   or when i do boast it is to put men off the scent   i boasted once to samson sahib when be offered to have me sent to college  telling him i was in the same school as himself and would learn the quicker   he has wondered ever since then what i meant          krishna   she laughed impiously   i wonder what samson sahib would not give to have me in his clutches at this minute   have i told you that gungadhura plots with the northwest tribes  and that the english know it   no   didn t i tell you   samson sahib would give me almost anything i asked  if he knew that it was i who told his government of gungadhura s plots   he would know then that with my knowledge to guide him he would be more than a match for gungadhura  instead of a ball kicked this and that way between gungadhura and the english   sometimes i almost think he would consent to try to make me maharanee     why not give him the chance then     for two reasons   the english too often desert their commissioners  my sure way is better than his blundering attempts   the other reason is an even better one  and you shall know it soon   i think  i do not know   i think  and i hope that the fat high priest of jinendra is playing me false  and has gone to samson sahib to make a bargain with him   samson sahib will consent to no bargains with that fat fool  if i am any judge of hucksters   but he will have his ears on end and his eyes sore with over  watchfulness from now forward   oh  i hope jinendra s priest has gone to him   i tried to stir treachery in his mind by brow beating him about the bargain that be tried to force from me     but what are you and the priest and samson all bargaining about   demanded tess    the treasure of sialpore   but i make no bargains   i  who know where the treasure is   why should i offer to share what is mine   i will have a marriage contract drawn  and you shall be a witness   that treasure is my dowry   listen   bubru singh my father died without a son  the first of all that long line who left no son to follow him   the custom was that he should tell his son  and none else  the secret of the treasure  he hated gungadhura   and  not knowing which the english would choose for his successor  gungadhura or another man  he told no one  making only hints to my mother on his death bed and saying that if i  his daughter  ever developed brains enough to learn the secret of the treasure  then i might also have wit enough to win the throne and all would be well     and you discovered it   how did you discover it      not i     who then     your husband did     my husband   dick blaine   but that can t be true   he never told me  he tells me everything     perhaps he would have told if he had understood   he hardly understands yet   only in part  a little     then how in the world      yasmini s golden laugh cut short the question as she rose to her feet with a glance at the westering sun    let us go   two hours from now we shall cross the border into another state   two hours after night fall our journey is ended   then the last game begins  the last chukker  and i win    tess wished then that they had never halted   the rest had given her muscles time to stiffen  and her nerves the opportunity to learn how tired they were   as the camels rose jerkily and followed their leader in line at the same fast pace as before she grew sick with the agony of aching bones and the utter weariness of motion repeated again and again without varying or ceasing   every ligament in her body craved only stillness  but the camel s unaccustomed thrust and sway continued  repeated to infinity  until her nerves grew numb and she was hardly conscious of time  distance  or direction   once again there was pursuit  but tess was hardly conscious of it   hardly realized that shots were fired  clinging to the saddle in the misery of a sickness more weakening and deathly than the sort small boats provide at sea   the sun went down and left her cooler  but not recovered  she knew nothing of boundaries  or of the changing nature of the country  side   it meant nothing to her that they were passing great trees now  and that once they crossed a stream by a wide stone bridge   the only thought that kept drumming in her mind was that dick  the ever dependable  had misinformed her   she had  fetched it up   a dozen times   true to his instruction  she had  carried on    but it did not pass   she felt more sick  more agonized  more weary every minute   but at last  because there is an end even to the motion of a camel  in this world of example instances  about two hours after nightfall the caravan halted in the shadow of great trees beside a stone house with a wall about it   her camel knelt with a motion like a landslide  and tess fell off forward on the ground and fainted  only snatched away by strong hands in the nick of time to save her from the camel s teeth   uncertain  unforgiving brutes are camels  ungrateful for the toil men put them to  for an hour after that she was only dimly conscious of being laid on something soft  and of supple  tireless women s hands that kneaded her  and kneaded her  taking the weary muscles one by one and coaxing them back to painlessness   so she did not see the dog arrive  trotters  the rampore great dane  cousin to half the mongrel stock of hindustan  slobbering on a package that his set jaws hardly could release   yasmini  scornful of the laws of caste and ever responsive to a true friend  pried it loose with strong fingers   it was she  too  who saw to the dog s needs  fed him and gave him drink  removed a thorn from his forefoot and made much of him  she even gave bimbu food  with her own hands  and saw that his driver and camel had a place to rest in  before she undid the string that bound the leather jacket of the package   bimbu on the camel had led the dog by the short route and  having nothing to be robbed of  had had small trouble with policemen on the way   the first thing tess was really conscious of when she regained her senses was a great dog that slumbered restlessly beside her own finger marked  disheveled  dusty  fifty dollar hat on the floor near by  awaking at intervals to sniff her hand and reassure himself  then returning to the hat to sleep  and gallop in his sleep   a rangy  gray  enormous beast with cavernous jaws that she presently recognized as trotters   then came the maids again  afraid for their very lives of the dog  but still more mindful of yasmini s orders   they resumed their kneading of stiff muscles  rubbing in oil that smelt of jasmine  singing incantations while they worked   they lifted the bed away from the wall  and one of the women danced around and around it rhythmically  surrounding tess with what the west translates as  influence   the spell that all the east knows keeps away evil interference   last of all by candlelight  yasmini came  scented and fresh and smiling as the flower from which she has her name  dressed now in the soft hued silken garments of a lady of the land    where did you get them   tess asked her    these clothes   oh  i have friends here   have no fear now  there are friends on every side of us    she showed tess a letter  pierced in four places by a dog s eye teeth    this is from samson sahib   do you remember how i prayed that jinendra s priest might think to play me false   i think he has   some one has been to samson sahib   hear this             the princess yasmini omanoff singh            your highness                    word has reached me frequently of late of pressure brought         to bear on you from certain quarters  and hints have been dropped         in my hearing that the object of the pressure is to induce you to         disclose a secret you possess   let me assure you that my official         protection from all illegal restraint and improper treatment is at your         service   further  that in case your secret is such as concerns vitally         the political relations  present or future  of sialpore the proper         person to whom to confide it is myself   should you see your way to         take that only safe course  you may rest assured that your own         interests will be cared for in every way possible                    i have the honor to be                    your highness  obedient servant                    roland samson  k  c  s  i      that looks fair enough   said tess    i dislike samson for reasons of my own  but      hah   laughed yasmini    he makes love to you   is it not so   he would make love to me if i gave him opportunity   what a jest for the gods if i should play that game with him and make him marry me   i could   i could make of samson a power in india   but the man would weary me with his conceit and his  orders from higher up  within a week   i can have power without his help   what a royal jest  though  to marry samson and intrigue with all the jealous english wives who think they pull the strings of government     you d get the worst of it   laughed tess    maybe   i shall never try it   i am more of the east than the west   but i will answer samson   bimbu shall remain here lest he talk too much  but the dog shall take a letter to tom tripe at dawn   samson knew hours ago that i have flown the nest   he will wonder how tom tripe holds communication with me  and so swiftly  and will have greater respect for him  which may serve us later     let me add a letter to my husband then  to tell him i m safe     surely   but now eat   eat and be strong   can you stand   can you walk  have the maids put new life in you    tess was astonished at her swift recovery   she was a little stiff  a little weak  a little tired   but she could walk up and down the room with her natural gait and yasmini clapped her hands    i will order food brought  listen   tonight i am abhisharika   do you know what that is  abhisharika    tess shook her head    i go to my lover of my own accord     that sounds more like west than east     you think so   you shall come with me and see   you shall play the part of cheti  the indispensable hand maiden   you and hasamurti  you must dress like her   simply be still and watch  and you shall see        chapter thirteen     of what use were the gift of gods  the buoyant sweetness of a virgin state  the blossomy delight of youth ablow with promise of fruit consummate  what use the affluence of song and marvel of delicious motion meet to grace the very revelings of fawn  could she not lay them at another s feet     i am a king s daughter    that was a night when the full moon rose in a sea of silver  and changed into amber as it mounted in the sky   the light shone like liquid honey  and the shadowed earth was luminous and still   the very deepest of the shadows glowed with undertones of half suggested color   hardly a zephyr moved    you see   said yasmini    the gods are our servants   they have set the stage    hand in hand  yasmini in the midst in spotless silken white   tess and hasamurti draped in black from head to foot  they left the house by a high teak door in the garden wall and started down a road half hidden by lacy shadows   all three wore sandals on bare feet  and tess was afraid at first of insects    have no fear of anything tonight   yasmini whispered    the gods are all about us   wasuki  who is king of all the snakes  is on our side    one could not speak aloud  for the spell of mystery overlay everything  they walked into the very heart of silent beauty   overhead  enormous trees  in which the sacred monkeys slept  dropped tendrils like long arms yearning with the love of mother earth   here and there the embers of a dying fire glowed crimson  and the only occasional sound was of sleepy cattle that chewed the cud contentedly  or when a monkey moved above them to change his roost   once  a man s voice singing by a fireside conjured back for a moment the world s hard illusion   but the stillness and the mystery overcame him too  and all was true again  and wonderful   hand in hand they followed the road to its end and turned into a lane between thorn hedges   now the moon shone straight toward them and there was no shadow  so that the earth was bright golden underfoot   a lane of mellow light on which they trod between fantastic woven walls  at the end of the lane they came into a clearing at a forested edge  where an ancient ruined temple nestled in the shadow of great trees  its stone front and the seated image of a long neglected god restored to more than earthly sanctity and peace by the cool  caressing moonlight    jinendra again   yasmini whispered    always jinendra   his priests are rascals  but the god himself is kind   when i am maharanee  that temple shall stand whole again    in front of the temple  between them and the trees  was a pond edged with carved stone   lotus leaves floated on the water  and one blue flower was open wide to welcome whoever loved serenity   still hand in hand  they crossed the clearing mid way to the pond  and there yasmini bade them stand    draw no nearer   only stand and watch    she had a great blue flower in her bosom that heaved and fell for proof of her own emotion   hasamurti s hand was trembling as she nestled closer  and tess felt her own pulsing to quick heart beats as she clasped the girl s   yasmini left them  and walked alone to the very edge of the pond  where she stood still for several minutes  apparently gazing at her own reflection in the moonlit water  or perhaps listening   there was no sign of any one else  nor sound of footfall   then  as if the reflection satisfied  or she had heard some whisper meant for her and none else  she began to dance  moving very slowly in the first few rhythmic steps  resembling a water goddess  the clinging silk displaying her young outline as she bent and swayed   she might have been watching her reflection still  so close she danced to the water s edge with her back turned to the moon   but presently the dance grew quicker  and extended arms that glistened in the light like ivory increased the sinuous perfection of each pose   still there was nothing wild in it  nothing but the very spirit of the moonlight  beautiful and kind and full of peace   she moved now around the water  in a measured cadence that by some unfathomable witchery of her devising conveyed a thought of maidenhood and modesty   it dawned on tess  who watched her spell bound  that there was not one immodest thought in all yasmini s throng of moods  but only a scorn of all immodesty and its pretensions   and whether that was art  or sheer expression of the truth within her rather than a recognition of the truth without  tess never quite determined   for it is easier to judge spoken word and unexpected deed than to see the thought behind it   that night yasmini s mood was simpler and less unseemly than the very virgin dress she wore   presently she danced more swiftly  making no sound  so phantom light and graceful that the rhythm of her movement carried her with scarce a touch to earth   that was strength as well as art  but the art made strength seem spiritual power to float on air   gaiety grew now into her cadences   the utter joy of being young   she seemed to revel in a sense of buoyancy that could lift her above all the grim deceptions of the world of wrath and iron  and make her  like the moonlight  all kind  all conquering  three times round the pond she leapt and gamboled in an ecstasy of youth undisillusioned   then the dance changed  though there was yet in it the heart of gaiety  there moved now in the steps a sense of mystery  a consciousness of close infinity unfolding  far more subtly signified than by the clumsy shift of words   and she welcomed all the mystery  greeted it with outstretched arms  was glad of it  and eager impetuous to know the new worlds and the ways undreamed of   minute after minute  rhapsody on rhapsody  she wooed the near  untouchable delights that  like the moonbeams  seem but empty nothing when the drudges seize them for their palaces of mud   nor did she woo in vain   there were stanzas in her dance of simple gratitude  as if the spirit of the mystery had found her mood acceptable and dowered her with new ability to see  and know  and understand  even the two watchers  hand in hand a hundred paces off  felt something of the power of vision she had gained  and thrilled at its wonder   borne on new wings of fancy now her dance became a very image of those infinite ideas she had seen and felt   she herself  yasmini  was a part of all she saw  mistress of all she knew  own sister of the beauty in the moonlight and the peace that filled the glade   the night itself   moon  sky and lotus dappled water  trees  growth and grace and stillness  were part of her and she of them   verily that minute she  yasmini  danced with the gods and knew them for what in truth they are  ideas a little lower  a little less essential than the sons of men   then  as if that knowledge were the climax of attainment  and its ownership a spell that could command the very lips of night  there came a man s voice calling from the temple in the ancient rajasthani tongue    oh  moon of my desire   oh  dear delight   oh  spirit of all gladness   come    instantly the dance ceased   instantly the air of triumph left her   as a flower s petals shut at evening  fragrant with promise of a dawn to come  she stood and let a new mood clothe her with humility   for all that grace of high attainment given her were nothing  unless she  too  made of it a gift   that night her purpose was to give the whole of what she knew herself to be   so  with arms to her sides and head erect  she walked straight toward the temple   and a man came out to meet her  tall and strong  who strode like a scion of a stock of warriors   they met mid way and neither spoke  but each looked in the other s eyes  then took each other s hands  and stood still minute after minute   hasamurti  gripping tess s fingers  caught her breath in something like a sob  while tess could think of nothing else than brynhild s oath            o sigurd  sigurd          now hearken while i swear          the day shall die forever         and the sun to darkness wear         ere i forget thee  sigurd       her lips repeated it over and over  like a prayer  until the man put his arm about yasmini and they turned and walked together to the temple  then hasamurti tugged at tess  and they followed  keeping their distance  until yasmini and her lover sat on one stone in the moonlight on the temple porch  their faces clearly lighted by the mellow beams   then tess and hasamurti took their stand again  hand in each other s hand  and watched once more   it was love making such as tess had never dreamed of   and tess was no familiar of hoydenish amours   gentle  poetic  dignified on his part  manly as the plighting of the troth of warriors  sons should be  yasmini s was the attitude of simple self surrender  stripped of all pretense  devoid of any other spirit than the will to give herself and all she had  and knowledge that her gift was more than gold and rubles   for an hour they sat together murmuring questions and reply  heart answering to heart  eyes reading eyes  and hand enfolding hand   until at last yasmini rose to leave him and he stood like a lord of squadroned lances to watch her go    moon of my existence   was his farewell speech to her    dear lord   she answered   then she turned and went  not looking back at him  walking erect  as one whose lover is the son of twenty kings  without a word she took tess and hasamurti by the hand  and  looking straight before her with blue eyes glowing at the welling joy of thoughts too marvelous for speech  led them to the lane  the village street  and the door in the wall again   the man was still gazing after her  erect and motionless  when tess turned her head at the beginning of the lane   but yasmini never looked back once    why did you never tell me his name   tess asked   but if yasmini heard the question she saw fit not to answer it   not a word passed her lips until they reached the house  crossed the wide garden between pomegranate shrubs  and entered the dark door across the body of a sleeping watchman  or a watchman who could make believe he slept   then    good night   she said simply    sleep well   sweet dreams   come  hasamurti  your hands are cleverer than the other women s    daughter of a king  and promised wife of a son of twenty kings  she took the best of the maids to undress her  without any formal mockery of excuse   two of the other women were awake to see tess into bed   no mean allowance for a royal lady s guest   very late indeed that night tess was awakened by yasmini s hand stroking the hair back from her forehead   again there was no explanation  no excuse   a woman who was privileged to see and hear what tess had seen and heard  needed no apology for a visit in the very early hours    what do you think of him   she asked    how do you like him   tell me     splendid   tess answered  sitting up to give the one word emphasis   but why did you never tell me his name     did you recognize him     surely  at once  first thing     no true born rajputni ever names her lover or her husband     but you knew that i know prince utirupa singh   he came to my garden party     nevertheless  no rajputni names her lover to another man or woman   calling him by his own name only in retirement  to his face     why  he  isn t he the one who sir roland samson told me ought to have been maharajah instead of gungadhura    yasmini nodded and pressed her hand    tomorrow night you shall see another spectacle   once  when rajputana was a veritable land of kings  and not a province tricked and conquered by the english  there was a custom that each great king held a durbar  to which princes came from everywhere  in order that the king s daughter might choose her own husband from among them   the custom died  along with other fashions that were good   the priests killed it  knowing that whatever fettered women would increase their sway   but i will revive it   as much as may be  with the english listening to every murmur of their spies and the great main not yet thrown   i have no father  but i need none  i am a king s daughter   tomorrow night i will single out my husband  and name him by the title under which i shall marry him  in the presence of such men of royal blood as can be trusted with a secret for a day or two   there are many who will gladly see the end of gungadhura  but i must try to sleep  i have hardly slept an hour   if a maid were awake to sing to me  but they sleep like the dead after the camel ride  and hasamurti  who sings best  is weariest of all     suppose i sing to you   said tess    no  no   you are tired too     nonsense   it s nearly morning   i have slept for hours   let me come and sing to you     can you   will you   i am full of gladness  and my brain whirls with a thousand thoughts  but i ought to sleep    so tess went to yasmini s room  and sat beneath the punkah crooning moody and sankey hymns and darky lullabies  until yasmini dropped into the land of dreams   then  listening to the punkah s regular soft swing  she herself fell forward on her arms  half resting on the bed  half on the chair  until hasamurti crept in silently and  laughing  lifted her up beside yasmini and left her there until the two awoke near noon  wondering  in each other s arms       chapter fourteen     he who is most easily persuaded is perhaps a fool  for the world is full of fools  and it is dangerous to deal with them   but perhaps he is a man who sees his own advantage hidden in the folds of your proposal  and that is dangerous too    eastern proverb    acting on instructions from your highness    it tickled gungadhura s vanity to have an englishman in his employ  but tom tripe never knew from one day to another what his next reception would be   on occasion it would suit the despot s sense of humor to snub and slight the veteran soldier of a said to be superior race   and he would choose to do that when there was least excuse for it   on the other hand  he recognized tom as almost indispensable  he could put a lick and polish on the maharajah s troops that no amount of cursing and coaxing by their own officers accomplished   tom understood to a nicety that drift of the rajput s martial mind that caused each sepoy to believe himself the equal of any other rajput man  but permitted him to tolerate fierce disciplining by an alien   and tom had his own peculiarities   born in a shorncliffe barrack hut  he had a feudal attitude toward people of higher birth   as for a prince   there was almost no limit to what he would not endure from one  without concerning himself whether the prince was right or wrong   not that he did not know his rights   his limitations were not prussian   he would stand up for his rights  and on their account would answer the maharajah back more bluntly and even offensively than samson  for instance  would have dreamed of doing   but a prince was a prince  and that was all about it   so  on the morning following the flight of yasmini and tess  tom  sore eyed from lack of sleep but with an eye opener of raw brandy inside him  and a sense of irritation due to the absence of his dog  roundly cursed nine unhappy mahouts for having dared let an elephant steal his rum  drilled two companies of heavy infantry in marching order on parade until the sweat ran down into their boots and each miserable man saw two suns in the sky where one should be  dismissed them with a threat of extra parades for a month to come unless they picked their feet up cleaner  and reported  with his heart in his throat  at gungadhura s palace   as luck would have it  the sikh doctor was just leaving   it always suited that doctor to be very friendly with tom tripe  because there were pickings  in the way of sick certificates that tom could pass along to him  and shortcomings that tom could overlook   he told tom that the maharajah was in no mood to be spoken to  and in no condition to be seen    then you go back and tell his highness   tom retorted    that i ve got to speak with him   business is business    the doctor used both hands to illustrate    but his cheek is cut with a great gash from here to here   he was testing a sword blade in the armory  last night  and it broke and pierced him     hasn t a soldier like me seen wounds before   i don t swoon away at the sight of blood   he can do his talking through a curtain if he s minded     i would not dare  mr  tripe   he has given orders   you must ask one of the eunuchs  really     i thought you and i were friends   said tom  with whiskers bristling    always   i hope always   but in this instance     tom folded both arms behind his back  drill master on parade fashion    suit yourself   he answered    friendship s friendship   scratch my back and i ll scratch yours   i want to see his highness   i want to see him bad   you re the man that s asked to turn the trick for me     well  mr  tripe  i will try   i will try   but what shall i tell him    tom hesitated   that doctor was a more or less discreet individual  or he would not have been sent for   besides  he had lied quite plausibly about the dagger wound   but there are limits    tell him   he said presently   that i ve found the man who left that sword in his armory o  purpose for to injure him   say i need private and personal instructions quick    the doctor returned up the palace steps   ten minutes later he came down again smiling  with the word that tom was to be admitted   in a hurry  then  tom s brass spurs rang on gungadhura s marble staircase while a breathless major domo tried to keep ahead of him   one takes no chances with a man who can change his mind as swiftly as gungadhura habitually did   without a glance at silver shields  boars  heads  tiger skins  curtains and graven gold ornaments beyond price  or any of the other trappings of royal luxury  tom followed the major domo into a room furnished with one sole divan and a little buhl work table   the maharajah  sprawling on the divan in a flowered silk deshabille and with his head swathed in bandages  ignored tom tripe s salute  and snarled at the major domo to take himself out of sight and hearing   soldier fashion  as soon as the door had closed behind him tom stood on no ceremony  but spoke first    there was a fracas last night  your highness  outside a certain palace gate    he pronounced the word to rhyme with jackass  but gungadhura was not in a mood to smile    an escaped elephant bumped into the gate and bent it   the guard took to their heels   so i ve locked  em all up  solitary  to think their conduct over    the maharajah nodded    good   he said curtly    i cautioned the relieving guard that if they had a word to say to any one they d follow the first lot into cells   it don t do to have it known that elephants break loose that easy     good     subsequently  acting on instructions from your highness  i searched the cellar of mr  blaine s house on the hill  chamu the butler holding a candle for me     what did he see   what did that treacherous swine see   snapped gungadhura  pushing back the bandage irritably from the corner of his mouth    nothing  your highness  except that he saw me lift a stone and look under it     what did you see under the stone     a silver tube  all wrought over with persian patterns  and sealed at both ends with a silver cap and lots o  wax     why didn t you take it  you idiot     two reasons   your highness told me to report to you what i saw  not to take nothing   and mr  blaine came to the top of the cellar ladder and was damned angry   he d have seen me if i d pinched a cockroach  he was that angry that he locked the cellar door afterward  and nailed it down  and rolled a safe on top of it     did he suspect anything     i don t know  your highness     what did you tell him     said i was looking for rum     doubtless he believed that   you have a reputation   you are an idiot  if you had brought away what you saw under that stone  you might have drawn your pension today and left india for good    tom made no answer   the next move was gungadhura s   there was silence while a gold clock on the wall ticked off eighty seconds    you are an idiot   gungadhura broke out at last    you have missed a golden opportunity   but if you will hold your tongue  absolutely  you shall draw your pension in a month or two from now  with ten thousand rupees in gold into the bargain     yes  your highness    a native of the country would have begun to try to bargain there and then   but there are more differences than one between the ranks of east and west   more degrees than one of dissimulation   tom gravely doubted gungadhura s prospect of being in position to grant him a pension  or any other favor  a month or two from then   a native of the country would have bargained nevertheless    keep that guard confined for the present   you have my leave to go    tom saluted and withdrew   he was minded to spit on the palace steps  but refrained because the guard would surely have reported what he did to gungadhura  who would have understood the act in its exact significance   as he left the palace yard he passed a curtained two wheeled cart drawn by small humped bulls  and turned his head in time to see the high priest of jinendra heave his bulk out from behind the curtains and wheezily ascend the palace steps    a little ghostly consolation for the maharajah s sins   he muttered  as he headed toward his own quarters for another stiff glass of brandy and some sleep   he felt he needed both  or all three    if it s true there s no hell  then i m on velvet   he muttered    but i m a liar   a liar by imputation  by suggestion  by allegation  by collusion   and in fact   now  if i was one o  them hindus i could hire a priest to sing a hymn and start me clean again from the beginning   trouble is  i m a complacent liar   i ll do it again  and i know it   brandy s the right oracle for me    but there was no consolation  ghostly or otherwise  being brought to gungadhura   jinendra s fat high priest  short winded from his effort on the stairs  with aching hams and knees that trembled from exertion  was ushered into a chamber some way removed from that in which tom tripe had had his interview  the maharajah lay now with his head on the lap of patali  his favorite dancing girl  in a room all scent and cushions and contrivances    that was how yasmini learned about it afterward    it was against all the canons of caste and decency to accord an interview to any one in that flagrant state of impropriety  to a high priest especially  but it amused gungadhura to outrage the priest s alleged asceticism  and to show him discourtesy  without in the least affecting his own superstitious scruples in the matter of religion    besides  his head ached  and he liked to have patali s resourcefulness and wit to reenforce his own tired intuition   the priest sat for several minutes recovering breath and equipoise  then  when the pain had left his thighs and he felt comfortable  he began with a bomb    mukhum dass the money lender has been to me to give thanks  and to make a meager offering for the recovery of his lost title deed   he has it back    gungadhura swore so savagely that patali screamed    how did he find it   where    mukhum dass had told the exact truth  as it happened  but the priest had drawn his own conclusions from the fact that it was samson s babu who returned the document   he was less than ever sure of gungadhura s prospects  suspecting  especially since his own night interview with the commissioner  that some new dark plot was being hatched on the english side of the river   having no least objection to see gungadhura in the toils  he did not propose to tell him more than would frighten and worry him    he said that a hand gave him the paper in the dark   it was the work of jinendra doubtless     pah   thy god functions without thee  then   that is a wondrous bellyful of brains of thine   do you know that the princess has fled the palace    jinendra s priest feigned surprise    is it not as clear as the stupidity on thy fat face that the ten times casteless hussy is behind this   bag of wind and widows  tenths   now i must buy the house on the hill from mukhum dass and pay the brute his price for it     borrowing the money from him first   the priest suggested with a fat smirk  none guessed better than he how low debauch had brought the maharajah s private treasury    go and pray   growled gungadhura    are thy temple offices of no more use than to bring thee here twitting me with poverty   go and lay that belly on the flags  and beat thy stupid brains out on the altar step  jinendra will be glad to see thy dark soul on its way to yum  the judge of the dead  and maybe will reward me afterward   go   get out here  leave me alone to think    the priest went through the form of blessing him  taking more than the usual time about the ceremony for sake of the annoyance that it gave  gungadhura was too superstitious to dare interrupt him    better tell that mukhum dass to sell me the house cheap   said the maharajah as a sort of afterthought   patali had been whispering to him   tell him the gods would take it as an act of merit     cheap   said the priest over his shoulder as he reached the door   i proposed it to him     that was not exactly true   he had proposed that mukhum dass should give the title to the temple as an act of grace    he answered that what the gods have returned to him must be doubly precious and certainly entrusted to his keeping   therefore he would count it a deadly sin to part with the title now on any terms     go   growled gungadhura    get out of here    after the priest had gone he talked matters over with patali  while she stroked his aching head   whoever knows the mind of the indian dancing girl could reason out the calculus of treason   they are capable of treachery and loyalty to several sides at once   of sale of their affections to the highest bidder  and of death beside the buyer in his last extremity  having sold his life to a rival whom they loathe   they are the very priestesses of subterfuge  idolators of intrigue  past  mistresses of sedition and seduction   yet even patali did not know the real reason why gungadhura lusted for possession of that small house on the hill  she believed it was for a house of pleasure for herself    persuade the american gold digger to transfer the lease of it   she suggested    he is thy servant   he dare not refuse    but gungadhura had already enough experience of richard blaine to suspect the american of limitless powers of refusal   he was superstitious enough to believe in the alleged vision of jinendra s priest  that the clue to the treasure of sialpore would be found in the cellar of that house  where jengal singh had placed it   impious enough to double cross the priest  and to use any means whatever  foul preferred  to get possession of the clue   but he was sensible enough to know that dick blaine could not be put out of his house by less than legal process  patali  watching the expression of his eyes  mercurially changed her tactics    today the court is closed   she said    tomorrow mukhum dass will go to file his paper and defeat the suit of dhulap singh   he will ride by way of the ghat between the temple of siva and the place where the dead afghan kept his camels   he must ride that way  for his home is on the edge of town    but gungadhura shook his head   he hardly dared seize mukhum dass or have him robbed  because the money lender was registered as a british subject  which gave him full right to be extortionate in any state he pleased  with protection in case of interference   he could rob dick blaine with better prospect of impunity   suddenly he decided to throw caution to the winds  patali ceased from stroking his head  for she recognized in his eyes the blaze of determination  and it put all her instincts on the defensive    pen  ink and paper   he ordered   patali brought them  and he addressed the envelope first  practising the spelling and the none too easily accomplished english    why to him   she asked  watching beside his shoulder    if you send him a letter he will think himself important   word of mouth      silence  fool   he would not come without a letter     better to meet him  then  as if by accident and      there is no time   that cursed daughter of my uncle is up to mischief  she has fled   would that yum had her   she went to samson days ago  the english harass me   she has made a bargain with the english to get the treasure first and ruin me   i need what i need swiftly     then the house is not for me     no    he wrote the letter  scratching it laboriously in a narrow italian hand  then sealed and sent it by a messenger   but patali  sure in her own mind that her second thoughts had been best and determined to have the house for her own  went out to set spies to keep a very careful eye on mukhum dass and to report the money lender s movements to her hour by hour   in less than an hour dick blaine arrived by dog cart in answer to the note  and patali did her best to listen through a keyhole to the interview  but she was caught in the act by gungadhura s much neglected queen  and sent to another part of the palace with a string of unedifying titles ringing in her ears   there was not a great deal to hear   dick blaine was perfectly satisfied to let the maharajah search his cellar   he was almost suspiciously complaisant  making no objection whatever to surrendering the key and explaining at considerable length just how it would be easiest to draw the nails   he would be away from home all day  but chamu the butler would undoubtedly admit the maharajah and his men   for the rest  he hoped they would find what they were looking for  whatever that might be   and he sincerely hoped that the maharajah had not hurt his head seriously   asked why he had nailed the cellar door down  he replied that he objected to unauthorized people nosing about in there    who has been in the cellar   asked gungadhura    only tom tripe     are you sure     quite   until that very evening i always kept the cellar padlocked   it s a yale lock   there s nobody in this man s town could pick it     well  thank you for the permission     don t mention it   i hope your head don t hurt you much   good morning    dick little suspected  as he drove the dog cart across the bridge toward the club  chuckling over the quick success of yasmini s ruse  that he himself had set the stage for tragedy       chapter fifteen     he who sets a tiger trap  hush  and watch  and wait   can t afford a little nap hidden where the twigs enwrap lest  it has occurred  mayhap a jackal take the bait  so stay awake  my sportsman bold  and peel your anxious eye  there s more than tigers  so i m told  to test your cunning by     me for the princess    it is not always an entirely simple matter in india to dismiss domestic servants   to begin with it was sunday   the ordinary means of cashing checks were therefore unavailable  and dick blaine had overlooked the fact that he had no money of small denominations in the house  it was hardly reasonable to expect chamu and the cook to leave without their wages   then again  sita ram had not yet sent new servants to replace the potential poisoners   and chamu had put up a piteous bleating  using every argument  from his being an orphan and the father of a son  down to the less appealing one that gungadhura would be angry   in vain dick reassured him that he and cook and maharajah might all go to hell together with his  dick blaine s  express permission   in vain he advised him to put the son to work  and be supported for a while in idleness  chamu lamented noisily   finally dick compromised by letting both servants remain for one more day  reflecting that they could not very well tamper with boiled eggs   lunch and dinner he would get at the english club across the river   for breakfast on monday he would content himself again with boiled eggs  and biscuits out of an imported tin  after which he would cash a check and send both the rascals packing   so the toast that chamu brought him he broke up and threw into the garden  where the crows devoured it without apparent ill effect   he went without tea  and spent an hour or so after breakfast with a good cigar and a copy of a month old nevada newspaper   that religious rite performed  he shaved twice over  it being sunday  and strolled out to look at the horses and potter about the garden that was beginning to shrivel up already at the commencement of the hot weather    if i knew who would be maharajah of this state from one week to the next   he told himself   i d get a contract from him to pipe water all over the place from the hills behind    he was sitting in the shade  chewing an unlit cigar  day dreaming about water pressure and dams and gallons per hour  when gungadhura s note came and he ordered the dog cart at once  rather glad of something to keep him occupied   as he drove away he did not see mukhum dass lurking near the small gate  as it was not intended that he should  mukhum dass  for his part  did not see pinga  the one eyed beggar with his vertical smile  who watched him from behind a rock  for that was not intended either   pinga himself was noticed closely by another man   the minute dick was out of sight mukhum dass entered the small gate in the wall  and called out for chamu brazenly   chamu received him at the bottom of the house steps  but mukhum dass walked up them uninvited    the cellar   he said   i have come to see the cellar   there is a complaint regarding the foundations   i must see     but  sahib  the door is locked     unlock it     i have no key     then break the lock     the cellar door is nailed down     draw the nails     i dare not   i don t know how   by what right should i do this thing     it is my house   i order it     but  sahib  only yesterday blaine sahib dismissed me in great anger because i permitted another one as much as to look into the cellar    if the tale yasmini told him on the morning of her first visit to tess had not been enough to determine mukhum dass  now  with the lost title deed recovered  the conviction that gungadhura wanted the place for secret reasons  and chamu s objections to confirm the whole wild story  he became as set on his course and determined to wring the last anna out of the mystery as only a money lender can be    with what money did you repay to me the loan that your son obtained by false pretenses   he demanded    i   what   i repaid the loan   i have the receipt   that is enough     on the receipt stands written the number of the bank note   i have kept the bank note   it was stolen from the princess yasmini   do you wish to go to jail   then open that cellar door     sahib  i never stole the note   wept chamu    it was thrust into my cummerbund from behind    but mukhum dass set his face like a flint  and the wretched chamu knew nothing about the law against compounding felonies   wishing he had had curiosity enough himself to search the cellar thoroughly before the door was nailed down  he finally yielded to the money lender s threats and between them  with much sweating and grunting  they pushed and pulled the safe from off the trap   then came the much more difficult task of drawing nails without an instrument designed for it   dick blaine kept all his tools locked up    there is an outside door to the cellar  behind the house   said chamu    but that is of iron  idiot  and bolts on the inside with a great bar resting in the stonework   are there no tools in the garden    chamu did not know  and the money lender went himself to see   there pinga with the vertical smile saw him choose a small crow bar and return into the house with it   pinga passed the word along to another man  who told it to a third  who ran with it hot foot to gungadhura s palace   once inside the house again mukhum dass lost no time  arguing to himself most likely that with the secret of the treasure of sialpore in his possession it would not much matter what damage he had done  he would be able to settle for it   he broke the hasp of the door  and levered up the trap  splintering it badly and breaking both hinges in the process  while chamu watched him  growing green with fear   then he ordered a lamp and went alone into the cellar  while chamu  deciding that a desperate situation called for desperate remedies  went up stairs on business of his own   it took mukhum dass about two minutes to discover the loose stone  less than two more to raise it  and about ten seconds to see and pounce on the silver tube   he was too bent on business to notice the man with the vertical smile peering down at him through the trap   pinga escaped from the house after seeing the money lender hide the tube inside his clothes  and less than a minute later a lean man ran like the wind to gungadhura s palace to confirm the first s report   with a wry face at the splintered trap door  and a shrug of his shoulders of the kind he used when clients begged in tears for extra time in which to pay  mukhum dass looked about for chamu with a sort of half notion of giving him a small bribe   but chamu was not to be seen   so he left the house by the way he had come  mounted his mule where he had left it in a hollow down the road  and rode off smiling   ten minutes later chamu and the cook both left by the same exit  chamu had with him  besides his own bundle of belongings  a revolver belonging to dick blaine  two bracelets belonging to tess  a fountain pen that he had long had his heart on  plenty of note paper on which to have a writer forge new references  a half dozen of dick s silk handkerchiefs and a turquoise tie pin   the revolver alone  in that country in those days  would sell for enough to take him to bombay  where new jobs with newly arrived sahibs are plentiful   the cook  not having enjoyed the run of the house  had only a few knives and a pound of cocoa   they quarreled all the way down hill as to why chamu should and should not defray the cook s traveling expenses   a little later  in the ghat between siva s temple and the building  where the dead afghan used to keep his camels  mukhum dass  smiling as he rode  was struck down by a knife blow from behind and pitched off his mule head foremost   the mule ran away   the money lender s body was left lying in a pool of blood  with the clothing torn from it  and it was considered by those who found the body several hours afterward and drove away the pariah dogs and kites  that the fact of his money having been taken deprived the murder of any unusual interest   late that evening dick blaine  returning from a desultory dinner at the club across the river  very nearly fell into the trap door  for the hamal had run away too  thinking he would surely be accused of all the mischief  and no lamps were lit    well   he remarked  striking a match to look about him   dad blame me if that isn t a regular small town yegg s trick   you d think after i gave gungadhura the key and all  he d have the courtesy to use it and draw the nails   his head can t ache enough to suit me   me for the princess  if i d any scruples  believe me  bo  they re vanished  gone  vamoosed  that young woman s going to win against the whole darned outfit  english  indian and all   me for her   chamu   where s chamu   why aren t the lamps lit    he wandered through the house in the dark in search of servants  and finally lit a lamp himself  locked all the doors and went to bed       chapter sixteen     the buildings rear immense  horizons fade and thought forgets old gages in the ecstasy of view  the standards go by which the steps were made  on which we trod from former levels to the new  no time for backward glance  no pause for breath  since impulse like a bowstring loosed us in full flight and in delirium of speed none aim considereth nor in the blaze of burning codes can think of night  the whirring of sped wheels and horn remind that speed  more speed is best and peace is waste  they rank unfortunate who tag behind and only they seem wise who urge  and haste and haste  new comforts multiply  for there is need   each ballot adds assent to law that crowds the days  none pause   none clamor but for speed  more speed  and yet  there was a sweetness in the olden ways     and since  my lords  in olden days     trotters  fed on chopped raw meat by advice of tess  and brushed by bimbu for an hour to get the stiffness out of him  was sent off in the noon heat with a double message for his master  one addressed to samson  one to dick blaine  and both wrapped in the same chewed leather cover  that the dog might understand   the mongrel in him made him more immune to heat than a thoroughbred would have been   in any case  he showed nothing but eagerness to get back to tom tripe  and  settling the package comfortably in his jaws  was off without ceremony at a steady canter    if all my friends were like that one   said yasmini   i would be empress of the earth  not queen of a little part of rajputana   however  one thing at a time    it was hardly more than a village that tess could see through the jalousies of her bedroom windows   the room was at a corner  so that she had a wide view in two directions from either deep window seat   there were all the signs of indian village life about her  low  thatched houses in compounds fenced with thorn and prickly pear   temples in between them   trades and handicrafts plied in the shade of ancient trees   squalor and beauty  leisure  wealth  poverty and lordliness all hand in hand  she could see the backs of elephants standing in a compound under trees  and there were peacocks swaggering everywhere  eating the same offal  though  as the unpretentious chickens in the streets   over in the distance  beyond the elephants  was the tiled roof of a great house glinting in strong sunlight between the green of enormous pipal trees   and there were other houses  strong to look at but not so great  jumbled together in one quarter where a stream passed through the village   yasmini came and sat beside her in the window seat  as simply dressed in white as on the night before  with her gold hair braided up loosely and an air of reveling in the luxury of peace and rest    that great house   she said  peering through the jalousies   is where the ceremony is to be tonight   my father s father built it   this is not our state  but he owned the land     doesn t it belong to gungadhura now   tess asked    no   it was part of my legacy   this house  too  that we are in   look  some of them have come on elephants to do me honor   many of the nobles of the land are poor in these days   one  they tell me  came on foot  walking by night lest the ill bred laugh at him   he has a horse now  he shall have ten when i am maharanee     won t the english get to hear of this   tess asked   yasmini laughed    their spies are everywhere   but there has been great talk of a polo tournament to be held on the english side of the river at sialpore   the english encourage games  thinking they keep us rajputs out of mischief   as indeed is true   this  then  is a conference to decide which of our young bloods shall take part in the tournament  and who shall contribute ponies   the english lend one another ponies   why not we   the spies will report great interest in the polo tournament  and the english will smile complacently     but suppose a spy gets in to see the ceremony   tess suggested   yasmini s blue eyes looked into hers and there was a viking glare behind them  suggestive of the wintry fjords whence one of her royal ancestresses came    let him   she said    it would be the last of him    tess considered a while in silence    when is the tournament to be   she asked presently    won t the english think it strange that the conference about men and ponies should be put off until so late     they might have   yasmini answered    they are suspicious of all gatherings   but a month ago we worked up a dispute entirely for their benefit   this is supposed to be a last hour effort to bring cohesion out of jealousy   the english like to see rajputs quarrel among themselves  because of their ancient saw that says  divide and govern    i do not understand the english altogether  yet   but in some ways they are like an open book   they will let us quarrel over polo to our heart s content    there is something very close to luxury in following the thread of an intrigue  sitting on soft cushions with the sunlight sending layers of golden shafts through jalousies into a cool room   so little of the strain and danger of it   so much of its engagement   tess was enjoying herself to the top of her bent    but when the ceremony is over   she said   and you yourself have proclaimed prince utirupa king of sialpore  there will still remain the problem of how to make the english recognize him   there is gungadhura  for instance  to get out of the way   and gungadhura s sons  how many has he     five  all whole and well   but the dogs must suffer for their breeding  who takes a reverter s colt to school into a charger   the english will turn their eyes away from gungadhura s stock     but gungadhura himself     is in the toils already   say this for the english   they are slow to reach conclusions  slower still to change their policy   but when their mind is made up they are swift   gungadhura has been sending messages to the northwest tribes   how do i know   you saw ismail  my gateman  his very brother took the letters back and forth     but why should gungadhura risk his throne by anything so foolish     he thinks to save it   he thinks to prove that the tribes began the dickering  and then to offer his army to the english  tom tripe and all   patali put him up to it   perhaps she wants a necklace made of hill men s teeth   who knows   gungadhura went deeply into debt with mukhum dass  to send money to the mahsudis  who think more of gold than promises  the fool imagines that the english will let him levy  extra taxes afterward to recoup himself   besides  there would be the daily expenses of his army  from which he could extract a lakh or two   patali yearns for diamonds in the fillings of her teeth     did you work out all this deep plot for yourself   tess asked    i and the gods   the gods of india love intrigue   my father left me as a sort of ward of jinendra  although my mother tried to make a christian of me  and i always mistrusted jinendra s priest   but jinendra has been good   he shall have two new temples when i am maharanee     and you have been looking for the treasure ever since your father died     ever since   my father prophesied on his death bed that i should have it in the end  but all he told to help me find it was a sort of conundrum   whoever looks for flowers   be said   finds happiness   who looks for gold finds all the harness and the teeth of war   a hundred guard the treasure day and night  changing with the full moon    so i have always looked for flowers  and i am often happy   i have sent flowers every day to the temple of jinendra     who or what can the hundred be  who guard the treasure day and night   tess wondered    that is what puzzled me   at first  because i was very young  i thought they must be snakes   so i made friends with the snakes  learning how to handle even cobras without fear of them   then  when i had learned that snakes could tell me nothing  but are only widyadharas  beautiful lost fairies dreadfully afraid of men  and very  very wishful to be comforted  i began to think the hundred must be priests   so i made friends with the priests  and let them teach me all their knowledge   but they know nothing   they are parasites   they teach only what will keep men in their power  and women in subjection  themselves not understanding what they teach   i soon learned that if the priests were treasure guards their charge would have been dissipated long ago   then i looked for a hundred trees  and found them   a hundred pipal trees all in a place together   but that was only like the first goal in the very first chukker of the game  as you shall learn soon     then surely i know   said tess excitedly    in the grounds of the palace across the river  that you escaped from the night before you came to see me  there is quite a little forest of pipals     nine and sixty and the roots of four   yasmini answered  her eyes glowing as if there were fire behind them    the difficulty is  though  that they don t change with the full moon   pipal trees grow on forever  never changing  except to grow bigger and bigger   they outlive centuries of men   nevertheless  they gave me the clue  not only to the treasure but to the winning of it    the afternoon wore on in drowsy quiet  both of the girls sleeping at intervals  waited on at intervals by hasamurti with fruit and cooling drinks   yasmini silent oftener than not as the sun went lower  as if the details of what she had to do that night were rehearsing themselves in her mind  no amount of questioning by tess could make her speak of them again  or tell any more about the secret of the treasure   at that age already she knew too well the virtue and fun of unexpectedness   they ate together very early  reclining at a low table heaped with more varieties of food than tess had dreamed that india could produce  but ate sparingly because the weight of what was coming impressed them both   hasamurti sang during the meal  ballad after ballad of the warring history of rajasthan and its royal heroines  accompanying herself on a stringed instrument  and the ballads seemed to strike the right chord in yasmini s heart  for when the meal finished she was queenly and alert  her blue eyes blazing   then came the business of dressing  and two maids took tess into her room to bathe and comb and scent and polish her  until she wondered how the rest of the world got on without handmaidens  and laughed to think that one short week ago she had never had a personal attendant since her nurse   swiftly the luxurious habit grows   she rather hoped her husband might become rich enough to provide her a maid always   and after all that thought and trouble and attention she stood arrayed at last as no more than a maid herself  true  a maid of royalty   but very simply dressed  without a jewel  with plain light sandals on her stockinged feet  and with a plain veil hanging to below her knees  all creamy white  she admitted to herself that she looked beautiful in the long glass  and wished that dick could see her so  not guessing how soon dick would see her far more gorgeously arrayed   yasmini  when she came into the room  was a picture to take the breath away   a rhapsody in cream and amber  glittering with gems   there were diamonds sparkling on her girdle  bosom  ears  arms   a ruby like a prince s ransom nestled at her throat   there were emeralds and sapphires stitched to the soft texture of her dress to glow and glitter as she moved   and her hair was afire with points of diamond light  coil on coil of huge pearls hung from her shoulders to her waist  and pearls were on her sandals    child  where in heaven s name did you get them all   tess burst out    these   these jewels   some are the gifts of rajput noblemen  some are heirlooms lent for the occasion   this  and this  she touched the ruby at her throat and a diamond that glittered at her breast like frozen dew    he gave me   he sent them by his brother  with an escort of eight gentlemen   but you should wear jewels  too     i have none  none with me      i thought of that   i borrowed these for you    with her own hands she put opals around tess s neck that glowed as if they were alive  and then bracelets on her right arm of heavy  graven gold   then kissed her    you look lovely   i shall need you tonight   no other human guesses how i need you   you and hasamurti are to stand close to me until the end  the other maids will take their place behind us   now we are ready   come    outside in the dark there were torches flaring  and low gruff voices announced the presence of about fifty men   once or twice a stallion neighed   and there was another footfall  padded and heavy  in among the stamping of held horses   the night was hot  and full of that musty mesmeric quality that changes everything into a waking dream   the maids threw dark veils over them to save their clothing from the dust kicked up by a crowd  and perhaps  too  as a concession to the none so ancient  but compelling custom that bids women be covered in the streets   yasmini took tess by the hand and walked out with her  followed closely by hasamurti and the other women  between the pomegranates to the gate in the garden wall   from that moment  though  she stood alone and never touched hand  or sought as much as the supporting glances of her women until they came back at midnight   a watchman opened the gate and  yasmini leading  they passed through a double line of rajput noblemen  who drew their sabers at some one s hoarse command and made a steel arch overhead that flashed and shimmered in the torchlight   beyond that one order to draw sabers none spoke a word   tess looked straight in front of her  afraid to meet the warrior eyes on either hand  lest some one should object to a foreigner in their midst on such a night of nights   in the road were three great elephants standing in line with ladders leaning against them   the one in front was a tusker with golden caps and chains on his glistening ivory  and a howdah on his back like a miniature pagoda  a great gray monster  old in the service of three rajput generations  and more conscious of his dignity than years  yasmini mounted him  followed by tess and hasamurti  who took their place behind her in the howdah  one on either side  hasamurti pushing tess into her proper place  after which her duty was to keep a royal fan of ostrich plumes gently moving in the air above yasmini s head   the other women climbed on to the elephant behind  and the third one was mounted by one man  who looked like a prince  to judge by the jewels glittering in his turban    his brother   hasamurti whispered   then again a hoarse command broke on the stillness   horses wheeled out from the shadow of the wall  led by saises  and the rajput gentry mounted   ten of them in line abreast led the procession  while some formed a single line on either hand  and ten brought up the rear   men with torches walked outside the lines   but no one shouted   no one spoke   straight down the quiet road under the majestic trees  with the monkeys  frightened by the torchlight  chattering nervously among the branches    to the right near the lane yasmini used the night before  and on toward the shadowy bulk of the great house in the distance the elephant trod loftily  the swing and sway of his back suggesting ages of past history  and ever lasting ages more to come   the horses kicked and squealed  for the rajput loves a mettled mount   but nothing disturbed the elephant s slow  measured stride  or moved the equanimity of his mahout   villagers came to the walls  and stood under the roadside trees to smile and stare   every man and child salaamed low as the procession passed  and some followed in the dust to feast their curiosity until the end of it  but not a voice was raised much above a whisper  except where once or twice a child cried shrilly    why the silence   tess asked in a whisper  and without turning her head yasmini answered    would you have the english know that i was hailed as maharanee through the streets   give them but leave and they would beat the tomtoms  and dance under the trees   these are all friends here    the great house was surrounded by a high wall  but a gate was flung wide open to receive them and the procession never paused until the leading elephant came to a halt under a portico lit by dozens of oil lamps  standing on the porch were four women  veiled  but showing the glint of jewels and the sheen of splendid dresses underneath   they were the first that night to give tongue in acclamation  raising a hub bub of greeting with a waving of slim hands and arms   they clustered round yasmini as she climbed down from the elephant  and led her into the hall with arms in hers and a thousand phrases of congratulation and glad welcome    four queens   hasamurti whispered   tess and hasamurti followed  side by side  not down the main hall  but to the left  into a suite of rooms reserved for women  where they all removed their veils and the talking and laughter began anew   there were dozens of other women in there  about half as many ladies as attendants  and they made more noise than a swarm of vassar freshmen at the close of term   the largest of the suite of rooms was higher than the rest by half a dozen steps   at its farther end was a gilded door  on either side of which  as far as the walls at each end  was a panel of very deeply carved wood  through the interstices of which every whisper in the durbar hall was audible when the women all were still  and every man and movement could be seen   yasmini took her stand close to the gilded door  and tess and hasamurti watched the opportunity to come beside her  no very easy matter in a room where fifty women jockeyed for recognition and a private word   but there came a great noise of men s voices in the durbar hall  and of a roll call answered one by one  each name being written in a vellum book  that none might say afterward he was present  who was not  and none might escape responsibility   the women grew silent as a forest that rustles and shivers in the night wind  and somebody turned down the lights  so that it was easier to see through the carved panel  and not so easy to be seen   immediately beyond the panel was a dais  or wide platform  bare of everything except a carpet that covered it from end to end   a short flight of steps from the center of it led to the durbar floor below   the durbar floor was of polished teak  and all the columns that supported the high roof were of the same wood  carved with fantastic patterns  from the center hung a huge glass chandelier  its quivering pendants multiplying the light of a thousand candles   and in every corner of the hall were other chandeliers  and mirrors to reflect the light in all directions   grouped in the center of the hall were about two hundred men  all armed with sabers   men of every age  and height and swarthiness  from stout  blue bearded veterans to youths yet in their teens   dressed in every hue imaginable from the scarlet frock coat  white breeches and high black boots of a risaldar major to the jeweled silken gala costume of the dandiest of rajput s youth   there was not a man present who did not rank himself the equal of all reigning kings  whatever outward deference the exigency of alien overrule compelled  this was a race that  like the poles  knew itself to have been conquered because  of subdivision and dissension in its ranks   no lack of courage or of martial skill had brought on their subjection   not nearly all their best were there that night   not even any of the highest placed  because of jealousy and the dread of betrayal   but there was not a priest among them  so that the chance was high that their trust would be well kept   these were the pick of rajputana s patriots  the men who loved the old ways  yet admitted there was virtue in an adaptation of the new  and yasmini  with a gift for reading men s hearts that has been her secret and her source of power first and last  was reviving an ancient royal custom for them  to the end that she might lead them in altogether new ways of her own devising   the roll call ended  a veteran with a jeweled aigrette in his turban stood apart from the rest with his back toward the dais steps and made a speech that was received in silence  though the women peering through the panel  fluttered with excitement  and the deep breathing in the durbar hall sounded like the very far off murmur of a tide   for he rang the changes on the ancient chivalry of rajasthan  and on the sanctity of ancient custom  and the right they had to follow what their hearts accounted good    and as in ancient days   he said   our royal women chose their husbands at a durbar summoned by the king   and because in ancient times  when rajasthan was a land of kings indeed and its royal women  as the endless pages of our history tell  stood proved and acclaimed as fit to govern  and defend  and die untarnished in the absence of their lords   therefore we now see fit to attend this durbar  and to witness and give sanction   once again  my lords  a royal daughter of a throne of rajasthan shall choose her husband in the sight of all of us let come of it what may    he ceased  and the crowd burst into cheers   yasmini translated his speech afterward to tess   he said not a word of gungadhura  or of the throne of sialpore  leaving that act of utter daring to the woman who was  after all  the leader of them all that night   now all eyes were on the dais and the door behind it   in the inner room the women stirred and whispered  while a dozen of them  putting on their veils again  gathered around yasmini  waiting in silence for her to give the cue   she waited long enough to whet the edge of expectation  and then nodded   hasamurti opened the door wide and yasmini stepped forth  aglitter with her jewels    ah h h   was her greeting  the unbidden  irrepressible  astonished gasp of mixed emotion of a crowd that sees more wonder than it bargained for   the twelve princesses took their place beside her on the dais  six on either side   immediately behind her tess and hasamurti stood   yasmini s other maids arranged themselves with their backs to the gilded door  she  tess and hasamurti were the only women there unveiled   she stood two minutes long in silence  smiling down at them while tess s heart beats drummed until she lost count  tess suspecting nervousness because of her own nerves  and not so wildly wrong    you re not alone   she whispered    you ve a friend behind you  two friends    then yasmini spoke    my lords    the word  bahadur  rolled from her golden throat like chords of beethoven s overture to leonori    you do our olden customs honor  true chivalry had nearly died since superstition and the ebb and flow of mutual mistrust began to smother it in modern practises   but neither priest nor alien could make it shame for maidenhood to choose which way its utmost honor lies   ye know your hearts  delight   goodness  love and soundless fealty are the attributes your manhood hungers for  of those three elements is womanhood   and so  as shri  goddess of all good fortune  comes ever to her loved one of her own accord and dowers him with richer blessing than he dreamed  true womanhood should choose her mate and  having chosen  honor him   my lords  i choose  in confidence of your nobility and chivalry    pausing for a minute then  to let the murmur of assent die down  and waiting while they stamped and shuffled into three long lines  she descended the steps alone  moving with a step so dignified  yet modest  that no memory of past events could persuade tess it was artistry  she felt  tess was sure of it  and swore to it afterward  in her heart of hearts the full spiritual and profound significance of what she did   beginning at the left end of the first line  she passed slowly and alone before them  looking each man in the eyes  smiling at each one as she passed him   not a man but had his full meed of attention and the honor due to him who brings the spirit of observance and the will to help another man succeed   back along the second line she went  with the same supreme dignity and modesty  omitting not even the oldest veteran  nor letting creep into her smile the veriest suggestion of another sentiment than admiration for the manliness by whose leave she was doing what she did   each man received his smile of recognition and the deference due his pride   then down the third line  yet more slowly  until tess had cold chills  thinking utirupa was not there   one by one she viewed them all  until the last man s turn came  and she took him by the hand and led him forth   at that the whole assembly milled into a mob and reformed in double line up and down the room   the same voice that had thundered in the darkness roared again and two hundred swords leapt from their scabbards  under an arch of blazing steel  in silence  yasmini and her chosen husband came to the dais and stood facing the assembly hand in hand  while the swords went back to their owners  sides and once more the crowd clustered in the center of the hall   there was a movement in among them then   some servants brought in baskets  and distributed them at about equal intervals amid the forest of booted legs   when the servants had left the hall  yasmini spoke    my lords  in the presence of you all i vow love  honor  fealty and a wife s devotion to the prince of my choosing  to my husband who shall be   who now is by gandharva ceremony   for i went to him of my own free will by night   my lords  i present to you     there was a pause  while every man present caught his breath  and the women rustled like a dove cot behind the panel      gunga khatiawara dhuleep rhakapushi utirupa singh  maharajah of sialpore    two hundred swords sprang clear again   the chandeliers rattled and the beams shook to the thunder of two hundred throats    rung ho   they roared    rung ho     rung ho   bringing down their right feet with a stamp all together that shook the building   then the baskets were cut open by the swords  points and they flung flowers at the dais  swamping it in jasmine and sweet smelling buds  until the carpet was not visible   the same black bearded veteran who had spoken first mounted the dais and hung garlands on yasmini and her prince  and again the hall shook to the roar of acclamation and the sharp ringing of keen steel   but yasmini had not finished all she had to say   when the shouting died and the blades returned to scabbards  her voice again stirred their emotions  strangely quiet and yet reaching all ears with equal resonance  like the note of a hidden bell    and since  my lords  in olden days it happened often that a rajput woman held and buttressed up her husband s throne  honoring him and rajputana with her courage and her wit  and daring even in the arts of war  so now   this prince shall have his throne by woman s wit   before another full moon rises he shall sit throned in the palace of his ancestors  and ye who love royal rajasthan shall answer whether i chose wisely  in the days to come    they answered then and there to the utmost of their lungs   and while the hall resounded to the crash and clangor of applause she let go utirupa s hand  bowed low to him  and vanished through the gilded door in the midst of her attendant women   for two hours after that she was the center of a vortex of congratulation   questions  whisperings  laughter and advice  while the women flocked about her and she introduced tess to them one by one   tess  hardly understanding a word of what was said to her  was never made so much of in her life  sharing honors with yasmini  almost as much a novelty as she  a western woman  spirited behind the purdah by the same new alchemy that made a girl of partly foreign birth  and so without caste in the hindu sense of it  revive a royal custom with its antecedents rooted in the very rocks of time   it was a night of breathless novelty   there were the inevitable sweetmeats  the inevitable sugared drinks  then the elephants again  and torches under the mysterious trees  with a sabered escort plunging to the right and left   the same torch lit faces peering from the village doors and walls   and at last the gate again in the garden wall  and a bolt shot home  and silence   then    did i do well   yasmini asked  leaning at last on tess    oh  my sister  without you there to lend me courage i had failed        chapter seventeen     how about the door   did somebody lock it   i   said the chairman   had the key in my pocket   who shut the windows   i   said the vice   i shut the window  it seemed to me wise    i   said the clerk   looked under the table and out on the balcony under the gable   then who let the secret out   who overheard  maybe a mouse  or the flies  or a bird     suppose i lock the door    tom tripe felt like a new man  and his whiskers crackled with self  satisfaction   for one thing  his dog trotters was back again  sore footed  it was true  and unable at present to follow him on his rounds   and rather badly scratched where a leopard must have missed his spring on the moonlit desert   but asleep in the stable litter  on the highroad to recovery   tom had ridden that morning  first to dick blaine up at the gold mine  because he was a friend and needed good news of his wife   then across the bridge to samson  straightening out the crumpled letter from yasmini as he rode  and chuckling to himself at the thought of mystifying the commissioner   and it all worked out the way he hoped  even to the offer of a drink  good brandy  hennesey s three star    how did you manage it   asked samson    the princess has disappeared  there s a rumor she s over the border in the next state   gungadhura has seized her palace and rifled it   how did you get my letter to her  and her answer so swiftly     ah  sir   said tom tripe mischievously   we in the native service have our little compensations  our little ways and means    that was better than frankincense and myrrh  to mystify a genuine commissioner   tom rode back to his quarters turning over the taste of brandy in his mouth  he had made a martial raid on samson s tantalus   and all aglow with good humor   not so samson   the commissioner was irritable  and more so now that he opened the scented letter tom had brought   it was deuced curt  it seemed to him  and veiled a sort of suggested laughter  if there was anything insinuative in polite phrases    the princess yasmini omanoff singh   it ran   hastens to return thanks for sir roland samson s kind letter   she is not  however  afraid of imprisonment or of undue pressure   and as for her secret  that is safe as long as the river runs through the state of sialpore    not a word more   he frowned at the letter  and read and reread it  sniffing at the scent and holding up the paper to the light  so that sita ram very nearly had a chance to read it through the knot hole in the door   the last phrase was the puzzler   it read at first like a boast  like one of those picturesque expressions with which the eastern mind enjoys to overstate its case   but he reflected on it   as an orientalist of admitted distinction he had long ago concluded that hyperbole in the east is always based on some fact hidden in the user s mind  often without the user s knowledge  he had written a paper on that very subject  which the spectator printed with favorable editorial comment   and mendelsohn k  c  had written him a very agreeable letter stating that his own experience in criminal cases amply bore out the theory   he rang the desk bell for sita ram    get me the map of the province    sita ram held it by two corners under the draughty punkah while samson traced the boundaries with his finger   it was exactly as he thought  without that little palace and its grounds  the state of sialpore would be bounded exactly by the river   take away the so called river palace with the broad acres surrounding it  and the river would no longer run through the state of sialpore   that would be the end  then  of the safety of the secret   there was food for reflection there   what if the famous treasure of sialpore were buried somewhere in the grounds of the river palace   somewhere  for instance  among those gigantic pipal trees   he folded the map and returned it to sita ram    i m expecting half a dozen officers presently   show them in the minute they come   and  ah  you d better lock that middle door    sita ram dutifully locked the door on samson s side  and drew the curtain over it   there was a small hole in the curtain  of peculiar shape   moths had been the verdict when samson first noticed it  and sita ram had advised him to indent for some preventive of the pests   which samson did  and the hole did not grow any greater afterward   samson had had to call a conference  much though he disliked doing it  the rules for procedure in the case of native states included the provision of an official known as resident  whose duty was to live near the native ruler   and keep a sharp eye on him   but samson  prince of indiscretion  had seen fit three months before to let that official go home to england on long leave  and to volunteer the double duty in his absence   the proposal having economic value  and there being no known trouble in sialpore just then  the state department had consented   the worst of that was that there was no one now in actual close touch with gungadhura   the best of it was that there was none to share the knowledge of samson s underlying scheme  which was after all nothing but to win high laurels for himself  by somewhat devious ways  perhaps  but justified in his opinion in the circumstances   and the very worst of it was that good form and official precedent obliged him to call a conference before recommending certain drastic action to his government  having no official resident to consult  he had to go through the form of consulting somebody   and the more he called in  the less likelihood there was of any one man arrogating undue credit to himself   they were ushered in presently by sita ram   ross  the principal medical officer came first   it was a pity he ranked so high that he could not be overlooked  but there you were   then came sir hookum bannerjee  judge of the circuit court  likely to have a lot to say without much meaning in it  and certainly anxious to please   next after him sita ram showed in norwood  superintendent of police   one disliked calling in policemen  they were so interfering and tactless  but norwood had his rights   then came topham  acting assistant to samson  loaned from another state to replace young wilkinson  home on sick leave  and full back on the polo team  a quiet man as a rule  anxious to get back to his own district  and probably reasonably safe   last came lieutenant colonel willoughby de wing  small  brusk and florid  acting in command of the   th sikh lancers  and preferring that to any other task this side of heaven or hell     nothing to do with politics  my boy   not built that way  don t like  em   never understood  em anyhow   soldiering s my business    it was well understood it was to be a secret conference   the invitations had been marked  secret     suppose i lock the door   suggested samson by way of additional reminder   and he did that  resuming his chair with an expression that permitted just the least suggestion of a serious situation to escape him  but he was smiling amiably  and his curled mustache did not disguise the corners of a wilful mouth    there is proof conclusive   he began     i ve telegrams here that you may see in confidence  that gungadhura has been trafficking with northwest tribes   he has sent them money  and made them promises  there isn t a shade of doubt of it   the evidence is black   the question is  what s to be done    they passed the telegrams from hand to hand  norwood looking rather supercilious    the police could handle espionage of that sort so much better    but it was the youngest man s place to speak first    depose him  i suppose  and put his young son in his place   suggested topham    there s plenty of precedent    the doctor shook his head    i know gungadhura   he s a bad strain   it s physiological   i ve made a study of these things  and i m as certain as that i sit here that any son of gungadhura s would eventually show the same traits as his sire  if you can get rid of gungadhura  get rid of his whole connection by all means     what should be done with the sons  then   asked sir hookum bannerjee  father of half a dozen budding lawyers    oh  send  em to school in england  i suppose   said samson    there s precedent for that too   but there s another point   mukhum dass the money lender has been foully murdered  struck down by a knife from behind by some one who relieved him of his money   either a case of simply robbery  or else      or else what   colonel willoughby de wing screwed home his monocle    that s as obvious as twice two   that rascal mukhum dass was bound to die violently sooner or later   he was notoriously the worst usurer and title jumper on this side of india   he charged me once a total of eighty five per cent  for a small loan  and legally  too   kept within the law  i know him     on the other hand   said samson   i ve been informed that the cellar of the house at present occupied by those americans on the hill  the gold miner  you know  blaine  was burgled last sunday morning   blaine himself complained to me   it seems that he had given gungadhura leave to search the cellar  at gungadhura s request  for what purpose blaine professes not to know   blaine himself  you may remember  lunched and dined at the club last sunday and gave three of us a rather costly lesson in his national game of poker   it took place while he was with us at the club   he has been able to discover  by cross examining some witnesses  beggars  i believe  who haunt the house   that mukhum dass got to the place ahead of gungadhura  burgled the cellar  removed something of great value to gungadhura  and went off with it   on the way home he was murdered     the murder of mukhum dass was known very soon afterward  of course  to the police   said norwood   but we can t do anything across the river without orders   why didn t mr  blaine bring his complaint and evidence to me     because i asked him not to   answered samson    we re mixed up here in a political case     damn all politics   growled willoughby de wing    if it can be proved that gungadhura murdered mukhum dass  or caused him to be murdered  i should say arrest him  try the brute and hang him   said topham    confound these native princes that take law into their own hands     i should say  let s prove the case if we can   said samson   and use that for an extra argument to force gungadhura s abdication   no need to hang him   if he d killed a princess  or an englishman  we d be obliged to take extreme measures   but  as de wing says  mukhum dass was an awful undesirable   if we hanged gungadhura  we d almost have to put one of his five sons on the throne to succeed him   if be abdicates  we can please ourselves   i think i can persuade him to abdicate  if norwood  for instance  knows of any way to gather secret evidence about that murder  secret  you understand me  norwood   we need that for a sword of damocles     who s to succeed him in that case   asked ross  the p  m  o    i shall recommend utirupa singh   said samson  with his eyes alert   ross nodded    utirupa is one of those men who make me think the rajput race is not moribund     a good clean sportsman   said topham    plays a red hot game of polo  too     pays up his bets  moreover  like a gentleman   said colonel willoughby de wing    i feel sure   said sir hookum bannerjee  seeing be was expected to say something   that prince utirupa singh would be acceptable to the rajputs themselves  who are long weary of gungadhura s way   but he is not married   it is a pity always that a reigning prince should be unmarried   there are so many opportunities in that case for intrigue  and for mistakes     gad   exclaimed willoughby de wing  dropping his monocle    what a chance to marry him to that young princess whatshername  you know the one i mean  the one that s said to masquerade in men s clothes and dance like the devil  and all that kind of thing   i know nothing of politics  but  what a chance     god forbid   laughed samson    that young woman is altogether too capable of trouble without a throne to play with   i suspect her  as it happens  of very definite and dangerous intentions along another line connected with the throne of sialpore   but i know how to disappoint her and stop her game   i intend to recommend  for the second time  by the way  that she  also  should be sent to europe for a proper education  but the point i m driving at is this   are we agreed as to the proper course to take with gungadhura    they nodded    then  as i see it  there s no desperate hurry   norwood will need time to gather evidence   i ll need specific facts  not hearsay  to ram down gungadhura s throat   i ll send a wire to the high commissioner and another to simla  embodying what we recommend  and  what do you say to sending for a battery or two     good   said willoughby de wing    a very good thought indeed   i know nothing of politics  except this   that there s nothing like guns to overawe the native mind and convince him that the game s up   let s see   who d come with the guns   coburn  wouldn t he   yes  coburn   he s my junior in the service   yes  a very good notion indeed   ask for two batteries by all means     i ll tell them not to hurry   said samson    it s hot weather   they can make it in easy stages     by jove   said topham    they ll be here in time for the polo   won t they beef     talking of polo  who s to captain the other side   is it known yet   asked de wing    utirupa   answered topham    there was never any doubt of that  we ve got collins to captain us  and latham and cartwright  besides me  we ll give him the game of his life     that settles quite an important point   said samson    the polo tournament   after it  rather  is the time to talk to utirupa   if we keep quiet until then   all of us  i mean  there ll be no chance of the cat jumping before the state department pulls the string   i feel sure  from inside information  that headquarters would like nothing known about this coup d etat until it s consummated   explanations afterward  and the fewer the better   have a drink anybody    in the outer office beyond the curtain sita ram cautiously refitted the knot into its hole  and sat down to write hurriedly while details were fresh in mind   ten minutes afterward  when the conference had broken up in small talk  he asked permission to absent himself for an hour or two  he said he had a debt to pay across the river  to a man whose wife was ill   one hour and a half later by sita ram s wrist watch  ismail  an afridi gate keeper at present apparently without a job  started off on a racing camel full pelt for the border  with a letter in his pocket addressed to a merchant by way of ostensible business  and ten rupees for solace to the desert police   tucked away in the ample folds of his turban was a letter to yasmini  giving sita ram s accurate account of what had happened at the secret conference       chapter eighteen     safe rules for defeating a rascal are three  and the first of them all is appear to agree  the second is boggle at points that don t matter  hold out for expense and emolument fatter  the third is put wish to seem wise on the shelf and keep your eventual plan to yourself  giving heed to the three with your voice and eyes level you can turn the last trick by out trumping the devil     be discreet  blaine  please be discreet    meanwhile  gungadhura was not inactive  nor without spies of his own  who told him more or less vaguely that trouble was cooking for him in the english camp   a letter he expected from the mahsudi tribe had not reached him   it was the very letter he had hoped to show to samson in proof of mahsudi villainy and his own friendship   but he rather feared it had fallen into secret service hands  in which case he might have a hard time to clear himself   then there was the murder of mukhum dass   he had not been able to resist that opportunity  when patali reported to him what mukhum dass had been seen to make away with   and now he had the secret of the treasure in his possession  implicit directions  and a map   he suspected they had been written by some old priest  or former rajah s servant  in the hope of a chance for treachery  and hidden away by jengal singh with the same object   there were notes on the margins by jengal singh   the thing was obviously genuine  but the worst of it was patali knew all about it now  and that cursed idiot blaine had complained to samson of burglary  after he learned that the cellar door was broken open by the money lender   why hadn t he come to himself  he wondered  and been satisfied with a string of promises   that would have been the courteous thing to do   instead of that  now samson s spies were nosing about  and only the gods knew what they might discover   the man who had done the murder was safely out of the way   probably in delhi by that time  or on his way there   but that interfering ass norwood might be awake for once  and if the murderer should happen to get caught  and should confess  as hired murderers do sometimes  it would need an awful lot of expert lying and money  too  to clear himself   with funds  ample extravagant supplies of ready cash  he felt he could even negotiate the awkward circumstance that he himself was deeply in debt to mukhum dass at the time of the murder   money and brains combined can accomplish practically anything   delhi and bombay and calcutta were full of clever lawyers   the point was  he must hurry  and he did not dare trust any one with knowledge of his secret  except patali  who had wormed out some and guessed the rest  because of the obvious risk of samson getting wind of it through spies and so forestalling him   he felt he had samson s character estimated nicely   arguing with himself  distracted between fear on one hand  and patali s importunity on the other  he reached the conclusion that dick blaine was his only safe reliance   the american seemed to have an obsession for written contracts  and for enforcing the last letter of them   well and good  he would make another contract with dick blaine  and told patali so  she agreeing that the american was the safest tool to use   she saw herself already with her arms up to the shoulders in the treasure of sialpore    the american has few friends   she said    he smokes a pipe  and thinks  and now that they say his wife has gone away there is less chance than ever of his talking     he will need to be paid   said gungadhura    there will be plenty to pay him with   she answered  her eyes gleaming   so gungadhura  with his face still heavily bandaged  drove in a lumbering closed carriage up the rough track to the tunnel dick had blasted in the hill side   the carriage could not go close to the tunnel mouth  because the track was only wide enough just there for the dump carts to come and go   so he got out and walked into the tunnel unattended   dick was used to seeing him about the works in any case and never objected to explaining things  several times over on occasion   he found dick superintending the careful erection of a wall of rock and cement  and he thought for an instant that the american looked annoyed to see him there   but dick assumed his poker expression the moment afterward  and you couldn t have guessed whether he was glad or sorry    you block the tunnel   the maharajah asked    the vein s disappeared   said dick    the rock s all faulty here this and that way  i m shoring up the end to keep the roof from falling down on us  and next i m going to turn sharp at right angles and try to find the end of the vein where it broke off     you are too near the fort in any case   said the maharajah   no use driving under the fort     what do you propose i should do   dick answered a trifle testily    dig elsewhere     what  and scrap this outlay     yes  i have a reason   a particular  eh  reason    dick nodded  poker face set solid   the maharajah paused   his advantage was that his face was all smothered in the bandages  and the dim light in the tunnel was another good ally   his back  too  was toward the entrance  so that the american s chance of reading between the words was remarkably slight   dick s back was against the uncompleted masonry    could i  eh  count on you for  eh  very absolute silence     i talk like that parrot in the story   dick answered    you  eh  know a little now of sialpore  mr  blaine   you  eh  understand how easily  eh  rumors get about   a little  eh  foundation and  eh   up side down pyramids of fancy  eh   you comprehend me     sure  i get you     eh  you have a good working party     fine   said dick    just about broke in   got the gang working pretty well to rights at last     would you  eh  it would take a long time to get such another party of laborers  eh  trained to work well and swiftly     months   said dick    unless you ve got tame wizards up your sleeve     eh  i was wondering  eh  whether you would be content to  eh  take your working party and  eh  do a little work for me elsewhere     i m right set on puzzling out this fault in the reef   dick answered promptly   my contract reads      for compensation  of course   said gungadhura    you would be adequately  eh  there could be a contract drawn     i wouldn t cancel this one  not for hard cash   dick retorted    no  no   i do not ask that   it would  eh  not be necessary     well  then  what s the proposal    dick settled himself back against the masonry crossed his feet  and knocked out ashes from his pipe   the maharajah walked twice  ten yards toward the entrance and back again    how long would it take you  eh  to  eh  what was it you said   to puzzle out this fault     no knowing     a short  eh  additional delay will hardly matter     not if i kept the gang in harness    twouldn t pay to let the team work slide   costs too much in time and trouble to break  em in again     then  eh  will you go and dig for me elsewhere     on what terms     the same terms     you pay all expenses and  what am i to dig for     gold     do i get my percentage of the gross of all gold won     yes   but because this is a certainty and  eh  i pay all expenses  eh   of course  in  eh  return for secrecy you  eh  should be well paid  but   eh  a certain stated sum should be sufficient  or a much smaller percentage     suppose we get down to figures   dick suggested    fifty thousand rupees  or one per cent     at my option    gungadhura nodded   dick whistled    there d have to be a time limit   i can t stay and dig forever for a matter of fifty thousand dibs    gungadhura grew emphatic at that point  using both clenched fists to beat the air    time limit   there must be no time lost at all   have you promised to be silent   have you promised not to breathe one little word to anybody    not to your own wife   not to samson   above all not to samson  then i will tell you    gungadhura glanced about him like a stage conspirator    go on   said dick    there s nobody here knows english except you and me     you are to dig for the treasure of sialpore   the treasure of my ancestors     fifty thousand dibs  or one per cent  at my option  eh   make it two per cent   and draw your contract     two per cent  is too much     get another man to dig  then     very well  i make it two per cent   but you must hurry     draw your contract   time limit how long     two weeks  three weeks  not more than a month at the very utmost  you draw the contract in english  and i will sign it this afternoon   you must begin to dig tomorrow at dawn     where     in the grounds of the river palace  across the river  beginning close to the great pipal trees     they re all outside the palace wall   how in thunder can i keep secret about that     you must begin inside the palace wall  and tunnel underground     dirt s all soft down there   said dick    we ll need to prop up as we go  lots of lumber   cost like blazes   where s the lumber coming from     cut down the pipal trees     man  we d need a mill     there is no lumber  not in such a hurry     what ll we do then   can t have accidents     pah   the lives of a few coolies  mr  blaine      nothing doing  maharajah sahib   murder s not my long suit     then pull the palace down and use the beams     you d have to put that in writing     include it in the contract then   now  have we agreed     i guess so   if i think of anything else i ll talk it over with you when i bring the contract round this afternoon     good   then i will give you the map     better give it me now  so i can study it     the  eh  risk of that is too great  mr  blaine     seems to me your risk is pretty heavy as it is   dick retorted    if i was going to spill your secret  i could do it now  map or no map    three times again gungadhura paced the tunnel  torn between mistrust  impatience and anxiety   at last he thrust his bandaged face very close to dick s and spoke in a level hard voice  smiling thinly    very well  mr  blaine   i will entrust the map to you   but let me first tell you certain things  certain quite true things   every attempt to steal that treasure has ended in ill luck   there have been many   all the conspirators have died  by poison  by dagger  by the sword  by snake bite  by bullets   they have all died  always   do you understand    dick shuddered in spite of himself    then take the map    gungadhura turned his back and fumbled in the folds of his semi european clothing   he produced the silver tube after a minute  removed the cap from one end  and shook out a piece of parchment   there was a dull crimson stain on it    the blood of a man who tried to betray the secret   said gungadhura   see the knife of an assassin pierced the tube  and blood entered through the hole   it happened long ago    but he did not pass the tube to dick that he might examine the knife mark    these notes on the edge of the map are probably in the hand of jengal singh  who stole it   he died of snake bite more than a year ago   they are in persian   he notes that four of the trees are dead and only their roots remain   therefore that measurements must allow for that   you must find the roots of the last tree  mr  blaine  and measure carefully from both ends  digging afterward in a straight line from inside the palace wall by compass   is it clear     i guess so   leave it with me and i ll study it    the maharajah kept the tube and left the parchment in dick s hands    this afternoon  then     this afternoon   said dick   when he had gone  dick resumed the very careful building of the masonry  placing the last stones with his own hands   then he went out into the sunlight  to sit on a rock and examine the parchment with a little pocket magnifying glass that he always carried for business purposes   he studied it for ten minutes    it s clever   he said at last    dashed clever   it  ud fool the prince of wales     dick had astonishing delusions as to the supposed omniscience of the heir to the throne of england     the ink looks old  and it s not metallic ink   the parchment s as old as methuselah  i ll take my oath on that   there s even different ink been used for the map and the margin notes   but that s new blood or my name s mike   that blood s not a week old   phew   i bet it s that poor devil mukhum dass   now   let s figure on this   mukhum dass burgled my house  and was murdered about an hour afterward   i think  i can t swear  because he didn t let me hold it  but i think that tube in gungadhura s hand was the very identical one that i hid under the cellar floor  that mukhum dass stole  and that the maharajah now carries in his pocket   this map has blood on it  what s the inference    he filled his pipe and smoked reflectively    the inference is  that i m accessory after the fact to the money lender s murder  unless     he finished the pipe  and knocked the ashes out      unless i break my promise  and hand this piece of evidence over to norwood   i guess he s arch high policeman here    as if the guardian angel of dick s conscience was at work that very minute to torment him  there came the sound of an approaching horse  and samson turned the corner into view    oh  hullo  blaine   how s the gold developing     so so   have they found the murderer of mukhum dass yet    samson dropped his reins to light a cigar  and took his time about it    not exactly     hum   you either exactly find the murderer  or you don t     we ve our suspicions     leading anywhere     too soon to say     if i was to offer to put you next to a piece of pretty evidence  how d that suit you    samson had to relight the cigar  in order to get opportunity to read dick s face before he answered    i don t think so  blaine  thank you  at least not at present   if you ve direct evidence of an eye witness  of course      nothing like that   said dick    well  i ll be candid with you  blaine   we know quite well who the murderer is   at the right moment we shall land on him hammer and tongs  but you see  we need to choose the right moment  for political reasons  now  technically speaking  all evidence in criminal cases ought to go to the police  and the police might act too hastily  you understand me     if you know who the man is  of course   said dick   there s nothing more i need do     except to be discreet  blaine   please be discreet   we shall get the man   don t doubt it   you and your wife have set us all an example here of minding nobody s business except your own   i d be awfully obliged if you d keep yourself as far as possible out of this mess  should we need any further evidence than we ve got already  i d ask you for it  of course     suits me all right   said dick    i m mum     thanks awfully  blaine   can i offer you a cigar   i m on my way to take a look at the fort   seems like an anachronism  doesn t it  for us to keep an old fashioned fort like this so near our own border in native territory  care to come with me   well  so long then  see you at the club again  i suppose    samson rode on    a narrow squeak that   said dick to himself  stowing away the map that he had held the whole time in his right hand in full view of the commissioner       chapter nineteen     the east to columbia  sister columbia  wonderful sister  weariless wings on aerial way  tell us the lore of thy loftiness  sister  we of the dark are astir for

  tess was in something very near to paradise  if paradise is constant assuaging of the curiosity amid surroundings that conduce to idleness  there were men on that country side in plenty who would not have dared admit a western woman into their homes   but even those could hardly prevent wives and daughters from visiting yasmini in the perfectly correct establishment she kept   and there were other men  more fearless of convention  who were willing that tess  if veiled  should cross their private thresholds   so there followed a round of visits and return calls  of other marvelous rides by elephant at night  because the daytime was too hot for comfort  and oftener  long drives in latticed carriages  with footmen up behind and an escort to ride before and swear at the lethargic bullock men  carriages that bumped along the country roads on strange  old fashioned springs   yasmini was welcome everywhere  and  in the cautious  tenfold guarded eastern way  kept open house   the women reveled in her free ideas and in the wit with which she heaped scorn on the priest made fashions that have kept all india in chains for centuries  mocking the priests  as some thought  at the risk of blasphemy   almost as much as in yasmini s daring they took ingenuous delight in tess  persuading yasmini to interpret questions and reply or  very rarely  bringing with them some duenna who had a smattering of english   all imprisoned folk  and especially women in the shuttered zenanas of the east  develop a news sense of their own that passes the comprehension of free ranging mortals   they were astonishingly well informed about the outer world  even the far flung outer world  yet asked the most childish questions   and only a few of them could have written their own names   they who were titled ladies of a land of ancient chivalry    wait until i am maharanee   yasmini said    the women have always ruled india   women rule the english  though the english hate the thought of it and make believe otherwise   with the aid of women i will change the face of india   the women and the gods    but she was careful of her promises  holding out no prospects that would stir premature activity among the ranks she counted on    promise the gods too much   she said   and the gods overwhelm you  they like to serve  which is their business  not to have you squandering on them   tell the women they are rulers  and they will start to destroy their empire by making public what is secret   if you tell the men that the women rule them  what will the men do     shut them up all the closer  i suppose   suggested tess    is that what they ever did   no   they will choose for them certain offices they can not fill because of inexperience  and put the noisiest women in them  and make mock of them  and laugh   not for a long time yet must india know who rules her     child  where did you learn all your philosophy   tess asked her  one night when they were watching the stars from the bedroom window seat    oh  men taught me this and that thing  and i have always reversed it and believed the opposite   why do men teach   to make you free  or to bind you to their own wheel   the english teach that english ways are good for the world   i answer that the world has been good to england and the english would like to keep it so   the pundits say we should study the philosophies   they made me study  hours and hours when i was little   why   to bind me to the wheel of their philosophy  and keep me subject to them   i say philosophy is good for pundits  as a pond is good for frogs   but shall i be a frog  too  and croak about the beauties of the mud   the priests say we should obey them  and pray  and make offerings  and keep the religious law   i say  that religion is good for priests  which is why they cherish it  and add to it  and persuade foolish women to believe it   as for the gods  if they are anything they are our servants     your husband is going to have an interesting time   laughed tess   yasmini s blue eyes suddenly turned soft and serious    do you think i can not be a wife    she asked    do you suppose there is no mother love in me   do you think i do not understand how a man needs cherishing   do you think i will preach to my husband  or oppose his plans   no   i will do as the gods do when the priests are asleep  i will let him go his own way  and will go with him  never holding back  and little by little he will learn that i have understanding   little by little he will grow into knowledge of the things i know  and he will be a very great man    there were no visits whatever from utirupa  for the country side would have been scandalized   only  flowers came every day in enormous quantities   and there was a wealth of horses  carriages  jewels and armed men at his bride s disposal that proved he had not forgotten her existence or her needs   she had claimed marriage to him by gandharva rite  and he had tacitly consented  but she was not ready yet to try conclusions with the secret  octopus influence of the priests  and there was another reason    if it should get to samson s cars that he and i are married  that would be the end of his chance of the throne of sialpore   samson is english of the english   he would oppose to the end the nomination of a maha rajah  whose wife has notions of her own  as i am known to have   they like him   my husband  because he plays good polo  and will bet with them  and can play cricket   and because he seems to follow no special line of politics  but if it were known he had a clever wife  me for wife  they would have none of him   i shall be a surprise for them when the die is cast    tess  was in almost daily communication with dick  for  what with tom tripe and sita ram and about a dozen other sworn accomplices  yasmini had messages coming and going all the time   camels used to arrive long after dark  and letters were brought in  smelly with the sweat of loyal riders who had hidden them from too inquisitive police   most of them carried back a scribbled word for dick   but he said nothing about the treasure in his curt  anonymous  unsigned replies  being nervous about sending messages at all   only  when in one letter he mentioned digging in another place  and tess read the sentence aloud  yasmini squealed with delight   the next day her own advices confirmed the hint  sita ram sending a long account of new developments and adding that  samson sahib is much exercised in mind about it     all goes well    yasmini belled in her golden voice    samson has seen the hidden meaning of my letter   if i had told him bluntly where the treasure is  he would have laughed and forgotten it   but because he thinks he reads the secret of my mind  he flatters himself and falls into the trap   now we have samson caught  and all is well     it would be a very canny person who could read the secret of your mind  i should say   laughed tess    i am as simple as the sunlight   yasmini answered honestly    it is samson who is dark  not i    yasmini began making ready for departure  giving a thousand orders to dependents she could trust    at the polo game   she asked tess   when the english ask questions as to where you have been  and what you saw  what will you tell them     why not the truth   samson expressly asked me to cultivate your acquaintance     splendid   tell them you traveled on camel back by night across the desert with me   by the time they have believed that we will think of more to add to it   we return by elephant to sialpore together  timing our arrival for the polo game   there we separate   you watch the game together with your husband   i shall be in a closed carriage  part of the time   i shall be there all the time  but i don t think you will see me     but you say they have rifled your palace   where will you sleep   tess asked    at your house on the hill     but that is in gungadhura s territory   aren t you afraid of him     of gungadhura   i   i never was   but now whoever fears him would run from a broken snake   i have word that the fool has murdered mukhum dass the money lender   you may trust the english to draw his teeth nicely for him after that   gungadhura is like a tiger in a net he can not break     he might send men to break into the house   tess argued    there will be sharper eyes than any of his watching    but tess was alarmed at the prospect   she did not mind in the least what the english might have to say about it afterward   but to have her little house the center of nocturnal feuds  with her husband using his six shooters  and heaven only knew what bloodshed resulting  was more of a prospect than she looked forward to    sister   said yasmini  taking her by both hands    i must use your house  there is no other place    no one could refuse her when her deep blue eyes grew soft and pleading  let alone tess  who had lived with her and loved her for a week    very well   she answered   and yasmini s eyes softened and brightened even more    i shall not forget    getting ready was no child s play   it was to be a leisurely procession in the olden style  with tents  servants  and all the host of paraphernalia and hangers on that that entails   not across the desert this time  but around the edge of it  the way the polo ponies went  and out of gungadhura s reach   for  however truly yasmini might declare that she was not afraid of gungadhura  and she vowed she never boasted   she was running no unnecessary risks   it takes a long time for the last rats to desert a sinking ship   the obstinate go down with it   and just as long for the last assassins to change politics   she was eager to run all the risks when that was the surest strategy  but cautious otherwise   the secret of her safety lay in the inviolable privacy surrounding woman s life in all that part of india  privacy that the english have respected partly because of their own inherent sense of personal retirement  partly because it was the easiest way and saved trouble   but mainly because india s women have no ostensible political power  and there is politics enough without bringing new millions more potential agitators into light  so word of her life among the women did not travel swiftly to official ears  as that of a male intriguer would certainly have done   utirupa was busy all day long with polo  and the powers that be were sure of it  and pleased   what gungadhura knew  or guessed  was another matter  but gungadhura had his own hands full just then   so they formed part of a procession that straggled along the miles  of elephants  camels and groups of ponies  carts loaded with tents  chattering servants  parties of rajput gentlemen  beggars  hangers on  retainers armed with ancient swords  mountebanks  several carriage loads of women  who could sing and dance and were as particular about their veiling as if lalun were not their ancestress  the inevitable faquirs  camel loads of entertainers  water carriers  sheep  asses  and bullock drawn  squeaking two wheeled carts aburst with all that men and animals could eat  three days and nights of circus life  as tess described it afterward to dick   yasmini and tess rode part of the way on an elephant  lying full length in the hooded howdah with a view of all the country side  starting before dawn and resting through the long heat of the day   but monotony formed no part of yasmini s scheme of life  and daring was the very breath she breathed   most of the time they rode horseback together  disguised as men and taking to the fields whenever other parties drew too close  but sometimes yasmini left tess on the elephant  and mingled freely with the crowd  her own resourcefulness and intimate knowledge of the language and the customs enough protection   nights were the amazing time   a great camp spread out under ancient trees  bonfires glowing everywhere  and native followers squatted around them   long  whinnying horse lines  elephants  great gurgling shadows  swaying at their pickets  shouting  laughter  music   and  over all  soft purple darkness and the stars   for it was something more than a mere polo tournament that they were traveling to   it had grown out of a custom abolished by the government  of traveling once a year to sialpore to air and consider grievances   a custom dating from long before the british occupation  when the princes of the different states were all in rival camps and that was about the only opportunity to meet on reasonably friendly terms   in later years it had looked like developing into a focus of political solidity   so some ingenious commissioner had introduced the polo element  eliminating  item after item  all the rest   then the date had been changed to the early hot weather  in order to reduce attendance   but the only effect that had was to keep away the english from outlying provinces   it was the one chance that part of rajputana had to get together  and the rajputs swarmed to the tournament  along the main trunk road that the english had reconstructed in early days for the swifter movement of their guns    it did not follow any particular trade route  although trade had found its way afterward along it    yasmini saw utirupa every night  she apparently as much a man as he in turban and the comfortable rajput costume  shorter by a bead  but as straight standing and as agile   tess and hasamurti used to watch them under the trees  ready to give the alarm in case of interruption  sometimes near enough to catch the murmured flow of confidence uniting them in secrecy of sacred  unconforming interviews   it was common knowledge that yasmini was in the camp  but she was always supposed to be tented safely on the outskirts  with her women and a guard of watchful servants all about her   there was no risk of an affront to her in any case   it was known that utirupa would attend to that   each night between the bonfires there was entertainment  men who walked tight ropes  wrestlers  a  performing horse  ballad singers and  dearest delight of all  the tellers of eastern tales  who sat with silent rings of men about them and reeled off the old  loved  impossible adventures of the days when the gods walked with men on earth  stories of miracles and love and derring do  with heroes who could fight a hundred men unscathed  and heroines to set the heart on fire   then off again before sunrise in the cool amid the shouting and confusion of a breaking camp  with truant ponies to be hunted  and everybody yelling for his right of road  and the elephants sauntering urbanely through it all with trunks alert for pickings from the hay carts   they were nights and days superbly gorgeous  all entertaining  affluent of humor   then on the third day  nearing sialpore toward evening they filed past two batteries of royal horse artillery  drawn up on a level place beside the road to let them by  an act of courtesy not unconnected with its own reward   it is never a bad plan to let the possibly rebellious take a long look at the engines of enforcement    ah   laughed yasmini  up in the howdah now beside tess on the elephant   the guns of the gods   i said the gods were helping us     look like english guns to me   tess answered    so think the english  too   so thinks samson who sent for them   so  too  perhaps gungadhura will think when he knows the guns are coming  but i know better   i never promise the gods too much  but let them make me promises  and look on while they perform them   i tell you  those are the guns of the gods        chapter twenty     a bad man ruined by the run of luck may shed the slime  they ve done it  times and again they ve done it  that turn to aspiration out of muck is quick if heart s begun it  if heart s desire s begun it  but  ware revenge if greater craft it is that jockeyed him to recognize defeat  or greater force that overmastered his   efficiency more potent than deceit that craved his crown and won it  safer the she bear with her suckling young  kinder the hooked shark from a yardarm hung  more rational a tiger by the hornets stung than perfidy outcozened   shun it     millions   think of it   lakhs and crores    the business of getting a maharajah off the throne  even in a country where the overlords are nervous  and there is precedent  is not entirely simple  especially when the commissioner who recommends it has a name for indiscretion and ambition   the government of conquered countries depends almost as much on keeping clever administrators in their place as on fostering subdivision among the conquered   so  very much against his will  samson was obliged to go to see a high commissioner  who is a very important person indeed  and ram home his arguments between four walls by word of mouth   he did not take sita ram with him  so there is a gap in the story at that point  partly bridged by samson s own sketchy account of the interview to colonel willoughby de wing  overheard by carlos de sousa braganza the goanese club butler  and reported to yasmini at third hand   there were no aeroplanes or official motor cars at that time to take officials at outrageous speed on urgent business   but samson s favorite study in his spare time was julius caesar  who usually traveled long distances at the rate of more than a hundred miles a day  and was probably short winded from debauch into the bargain   what the great julius could do  samson could do as well   but in spite of whip and spur and post  ruthless robbery of other people s reserved accommodation  and a train caught by good luck on the last stage  it took him altogether seven valuable days and nights   for there was delay  too  while the high commissioner wired to simla in code for definite permission to be drastic   the telegram from the secretary of state pointed out  as samson had predicted that it would  the desirability of avoiding impeachment and trial if that were possible  in view of the state of public unrest in india and the notorious eagerness of parliament at home to interfere in indian affairs    get him to abdicate   was the meat of the long message    can you do it   asked the high commissioner    leave that to me   boasted samson    and now this other matter  these  islands  as they re called   it s absurd and expensive to continue keeping up a fort inside the maharajah s territory   there s no military advantage to us in having it so near our border   and there are totally unnecessary problems of administration that are entailed by the maharajah administering a small piece of territory on our side of the river   i ve had a contract drawn for your approval  sir hookum bannerjee drew it  he s a very able lawyer  stipulating with utirupa  in consideration of our recognition of himself and his heirs as rulers of the state of sialpore  that he shall agree to exchange his palace and land on our side of the river against our fort on his side   what do you think of it     it isn t a good bargain   he ought to give us more than that in the circumstances  against a fort and  and all that kind of thing     it s a supremely magnificent bargain   retorted samson    altogether overlooking what we ll save in money by not having to garrison that absurd fort  it s the best financial bargain this province ever had the chance of     how d ye mean    samson whispered   even those four solid walls were not discreet enough    the treasure of sialpore is buried in the river palace grounds   millions  think of it  millions   lakhs and crores    the high commissioner whistled    that  ud mean something to the province  wouldn t it   show me your proofs    how samson got around the fact that he had no actually definite proofs  he never told   but he convinced the high commissioner  who never told either  unless to somebody at simla  who buried the secret among the state department files    i ll wire simla   said the high commissioner presently   for permission to authorize you to set your signature to that contract on behalf of government  the minute i get it i ll wire you to sialpore and confirm by letter   now you d better get back to your post in a hurry   and don t forget  it would be difficult in a case like this to err on the side of silence  samson  who ll have to be told     nobody but willoughby de wing   i ll have to ask him for troops to guard the river palace grounds   there s a confounded american digging this minute in the river palace grounds by arrangement with gungadhura   he ll have to be stopped  and i ll have to make some sort of explanation     what s an american doing in sialpore     prospecting   has a contract with gungadhura     um m m   we ll have standard oil in next   better point out to utirupa that contracts with foreigner s aren t regarded cordially     that s easily done   said samson    utirupa is nothing if not anxious to please     yes  utirupa is a very fine young fellow  and a good sportsman  too  i m told     there is no reason why utirupa should recognize the contract between gungadhura and the american   it was a private contract  no official sanction   if gungadhura isn t in position to continue it      exactly   well  good by   i ll look forward to a good report from you    by train and horse and tonga samson contrived to reach sialpore on the morning before the day set for the polo tournament   he barely allowed himself time to shave before going to see dick blaine  and found him  as he expected  at the end of the tunnel nearly a hundred yards long that started from inside the palace wall and passed out under it  the guards at the gate did not dare refuse the commissioner admission  so far  dick had not begun demolition of the palace  but had dragged together enough lumber by pulling down sheds and outhouses   he was not a destructive minded man    will you come outside and talk with me   samson shouted  amid the din of pick and shovel work    sure    dick s poker face was in perfect working order by the time they reached the light   but he stood with his back to the sun and let samson have the worst of the position    you re wasting time and money  blaine   i ve come to tell you so     now  that s good of you     your contract with gungadhura is not worth the paper it s written on     how so     he will not be maharajah after noon today     you don t mean it     that information is confidential  but the news will be out by tomorrow  the british administration intends to take over all the land on this side of the river   that s confidential too   between you and me  our government would never recognize a contract between you and gungadhura   i warned you once  and your wife a second time     sure  she told me     well   you and i have been friends  blaine   i d like you to regard this as not personal   but      oh  i get you   i m to call the men off   that it     you ve only until tomorrow in any case     and gungadhura  broke  to look to for the pay roll   well  as you say  what s the use     i d pay your men off altogether  if i were you     they re a good gang     no doubt   we ve all admired your ability to make men work   but there ll be a new maharajah in a day or two  and  strictly between you and me  as one friend to another  there ll be a very slight chance indeed of your getting a contract from the incoming man to carry on your mining in the hills  i d like to save you trouble and expense     real good of you     er  found anything down there   samson nodded over his shoulder toward the tunnel mouth    not yet     any signs of anything     not yet    samson looked relieved    by the way   you mentioned the other day something about evidence relating to the murder of mukhum dass     i did     was it anything important     maybe   looked so to me     would you mind giving me an outline of it     you said that day you knew who murdered mukhum dass     yes   when i got in this morning there was a note on my desk from norwood  the superintendent of police  to say that they ve arrested your butler and cook  and the murderer of mukhum dass all hiding together near a railway station   the murderer has squealed  as you americans say  they often do when they re caught   he has told who put him up to it     guess i ll give you this  then   it s the map out of the silver tube that mukhum dass burgled from my cellar   gungadhura gave it to me with instructions to dig here   you ll note there s blood on it    samson s eyes looked hardly interested as he took it   then he looked  and they blazed   he put it in his inner pocket hurriedly    too bad  blaine   he laughed    so you even had a map of the treasure  eh  another day or two and you d have forestalled us   i suppose you d a contract with gungadhura for a share of it     you bet     well  it wasn t registered   i doubt if you could have enforced it  gungadhura is an awful rascal     gee   lied dick    i never thought of that   i had my other contract registered all right  in your office  you remember     yes   i warned you at the time about gungadhura     you did   i remember now   you did   well  i suppose the wife and i ll be heading for the u  s  a  soon  richer by the experience   still  i reckon i ll wait around and see the new maharajah in the saddle  and watch what comes of it     you ve no chance  blaine  believe me     all right  i ll think it over   meanwhile  i ll whistle off these men    the next man samson interviewed was willoughby de wing    let me have a commissioner s escort  please   he demanded    i m going to see gungadhura now   you d better follow up with a troop to r eplace the maharajah s guards around his palace   we can t put him under arrest without impeaching him   but  make it pretty plain to the guard they re there to protect a man who has abdicated   that no one s to be allowed in  and nobody out unless he can explain his business  then  can you spare some guards for another job   i want about twenty men on the river palace at once   caution them carefully   nobody s to go inside the grounds   order the maharajah s guards away   it s a little previous   his officers will try to make trouble of course   but an apology at the proper time will cover that     what s the new excitement   asked the colonel    more murders  more princesses out at night     this is between you and me   not a word to a living soul  de wing   samson paused  then whispered    the treasure of sialpore     what  in the palace     in the grounds   there s a tunnel already half dug  leading toward it from inside the palace wall   i ve proof of the location in my pocket     gad s teeth   barked willoughby de wing    all right  i ll have your escort in a jiffy   have a whisky and soda  my boy  to stiffen you before the talk with gungadhura    a little less than half an hour later samson drove across the bridge in the official landau  followed by an officer  a jemadar  a naik and eight troopers of de wing s sikh cavalry   willoughby de wing drove in the carriage with him as a witness   they entered the palace together  and were kept waiting so long that samson sent the major domo to the maharajah a second time with a veiled threat to repeat  said slowly    say the business is urgent and that i shall not be held responsible for consequences if he doesn t see me at once     gad   swore de wing  screwing in his monocle    i d like a second whisky and soda   i suppose there s none here   i hate to see a man broke  even a blackguard    gungadhura received them at last  seated  in the official durbar room  the bandages were gone from his face  but a strip of flesh colored court plaster from eye to lip gave him an almost comical look of dejection  and he lolled in the throne chair with his back curved and head hung forward  scowling as a man does not who looks forward to the interview   samson cleared his throat  and read what be had to say  holding the paper straight in front of him    i have a disagreeable task of informing your highness that your correspondence with the mahsudi tribe is known to his majesty s government    gungadhura scowled more deeply  but made no answer    amounting as it does to treason  at a time when his majesty s government are embarrassed by internal unrest  your act can not be overlooked    gungadhura made a motion as if to interrupt  but thought better of it    in the circumstances i have the honor to advise your highness that the wisest course  and the only course that will avoid impeachment  is abdication    gungadhura shook his head violently    i can explain   he said   i have proofs    samson turned the paper over  paused a moment  and began to read the second sheet    it is known who murdered mukhum dass   the assassin has been caught  and has confessed    gungadhura s eyes that had been dull  and almost listless hitherto  began to glare like an animal s    i have here    samson reached in his pocket   a certain piece of parchment   a map in fact  that was stolen from the body of mukhum dass   perhaps your highness will recognize it   look    gungadhura looked  and started like a man stung   samson returned the map to his pocket  for the maharajah almost looked like trying to snatch it   but instead he collapsed in his chair again    if i abdicate   he asked  as if his throat and lips could hardly form the words    that would be sufficient   the assassin would then be allowed to plead guilty to another charge there is against him  and the matter would be dropped     i abdicate     on behalf of his majesty s government i accept the abdication   sign this  please    samson laid a formal written act of abdication on the table by the throne  gungadhura signed it   willoughby de wing wrote his signature as witness  samson took it back and folded it away    arrangements will be made for your highness to leave sialpore tomorrow morning  with a sufficient escort for your protection   provision will be made in due course for your private residence elsewhere   be good enough to hold yourself and your family in readiness tomorrow morning     but my son   exclaimed gungadhura    i abdicate in favor of my son     in case of abdication by a reigning prince  or deposition of a reigning prince   said samson   the government of india reserves the right to appoint his successor  from among eligible members of his family if there be any  but to appoint his successor in any case   there is ample precedent     and my son     will certainly not be considered    gungadhura glanced about him like a frenzied man  and then lay back in a state of near collapse   samson and de wing both bowed  and left the room    poor devil   said de wing   i m sorry for him     would you be a good fellow   said samson   and send off this wire for me   there  i ve added the exact time of the abdication   i ve got to go now and summon a durbar of gungadhura s state officers  and tell them in confidence what s happened   i shall hint pretty broadly that utirupa is our man  and then ask them which prince they d like to have succeed     good   said de wing    nothing like tact   why not meet me at the club for a whisky and soda afterward    inside the durbar hall gungadhura sat alone for just so long as it took the sound of the closing door to die away   then another door  close behind the throne chair opened  and patali entered   she looked at him with pity on her face  and curiosity    that american sold you   she said after a minute    eh     i say  that american sold you   he sold you  and the map  and the treasure to the english     i know it   i know it     if i were a man     she waited  but he gave no sign of manhood    if i were a man i know what i would do     peace  patali   i am a ruined man   they will all desert me as soon as the news is out   they are deserting now   i feel it in my bones   i have none to send     send   it is only maharajahs who must send   men do their own work  i know what i would do to an american or any other man  who sold me        chapter twenty one     the king sent his army and said   lo  i did it   consider my prowess and my strategy    but the gods laughed    eastern proverb    the guns of the gods    very shortly after dawn on the morning of the polo game yasmini left the blaines  house on business of her own   the news of gungadhura s abdication was abroad already  many times multiplied by each mouth until two batteries of guns had become an army corps   but what caused the greatest excitement was the news  first of all whispered  then confirmed  that gungadhura himself was missing   that disturbing knowledge was the factor that prevented yasmini from returning to her own rifled palace and making the best of it   for it would take time to hedge the place about properly with guards   there was simply no knowing what gungadhura might be up to   she judged it probable that he had seen through her whole plot in the drear light of revelation that so often comes to stricken men  and in that case her own life was likely in danger every second he was still at liberty   but she sent word to utirupa  too  to be on the alert   and she saw him herself that morning  in her favorite disguise of a rangar zemindari  which is a rajput landowner turned muhammadan   the disguise precluded any hindu interference  and muhammadans on that country side  who might have questioned her  were scarce   the polo did not take place until late afternoon  because of the heat  but the grounds were crowded long before the time by a multi colored swarm in gala mood  whom the artillerymen  pressed into service as line keepers  had hard work to keep back of the line   there was a rope around three sides of the field  but it broke repeatedly  and in the end the gunners had to be stationed a few feet apart all down the side opposite the grand stand to keep the crowd from breaking through   there were carriages in swarms  ranging from the spider wheel gig of a british subaltern to the four in hand of rajput nobility  kept pretty carefully apart  though   the conquerors of india don t mix with the conquered  as a rule  except officially   and there were half a dozen shuttered carriages that might have contained ladies  and might not  none knew   it was a crowd that knew polo from the inside outward  and when the ponies were brought at last and stood in line below the grand stand  each in charge of his sais  there grew a great murmur of critical approval  for the points of a horse in rajputana are as the lines of a yacht at marblehead  and the marks of a dog in yorkshire   the very urchins know them   the bombay side of india had been scoured pretty thoroughly for mounts for that event   the rajputs had on the whole the weight of money  and perhaps the showiest ponies  but the english team  nearly all darker in color as it happened  except for one pie bald  looked trained up to the last notch and bore the air of knowing just what to expect  that is as unmistakable in horses as in men   tom tripe was there with his dog   trotters had the self imposed and wholly agreeable task of chasing all unattached dogs off the premises  but tom tripe himself was keeping rather in the background  because technically  as a servant of gungadhura  he was in a delicate position  a voice that he could swear he almost recognized whispered to him in the crowd that the english were going to forbid the next maharajah to have any but employees of his own race   and a laugh that he could pick out of a million greeted his change of countenance   but though he turned very swiftly  and had had no brandy since morning to becloud his vision  he failed to see his tormentor   tess and dick drove down in ample time  as they had imagined  and found hard work to squeeze the dog cart in between the phalanxes of wheels already massed on the ground   when they went to the grand stand it was to find not a seat left in the rows reserved for ordinary folk   so samson  who arrived late too  magnificent in brand new riding boots  invited them to sit next him in front   the ground was in perfect condition  a trifle hard  because of the season  but flat as a billiard table and as fast as even rajputs could desire  a committee of them had been going over it daily for a week past  recommending touches here  suggesting something there  neglecting not an inch  because the finer stick work of the rajput team would be lost on uneven ground   and the english had been sportsmen enough to accommodate them without a murmur   when a little bell rang and the teams turned out for the first chukker in deathly silence  it was evident at once what the rajput strategy would be  they had brought out their fastest ponies to begin with  determined to take the lead at the start and hold it   one could hear the crowd breathe when the whistle blew   for in india polo is a game to watch  not an opportunity for small talk   instantly the ball went clipping toward the english goal  to be checked by topham at full back  who sent it out rattling to the right wing   but the rajput left wing man  a young cousin of utirupa  cut in like an arrow   the ball crossed over to the right wing  where utirupa took it  galloping down the line on a chestnut mare that had the speed of wind   topham  racing to intercept the ball  missed badly   a second later the rajput center thundered past both men and scored the goal  amid a roar from the spectators  less than a minute from the start    dick   tess exclaimed    you ought to be ashamed of me   i m rooting for the rajputs against my own color     so m i   he answered    i wish to glory there was some one here to bet with    samson overheard    which way do you want to bet   he asked    a thousand on the rajputs     thousand what     dollars   three thousand rupees     confound it  you americans are all too rich   never mind  i ll take you     a bet   dick answered  and both men wrote it down   about nine words were said by the captain of the english team as they rode back to the center of the field  and when the ball was in play again there was no more of the scattering open play that suited the other side  but a close  short hitting  chop and follow method that tried ponies  tempers  and a scrimmage every ten yards that made all unavailing the rajputs  speed and dash   whenever a stroke of lightning wrist work sent the ball clipping down field topham returned it to the center and the scrimmage began all over again   the first chukker ended in mid field  with the score        both sides brought out fresh ponies for the second  and the rajputs tried again to score with their favorite tactics of long hitting and tremendous speed   but the english were playing dogged does it  and topham on the pie bald at full back was invincible   nothing passed him   nor were the english slow   three times they seized opportunity in mid field and rode with a burst of fiery hitting toward the rajput goal   three times the gunners down the line began to yell   the english team were getting together  and the rajputs a little wild   but the chukker ended with the same score          how d you feel about it now   asked samson  looking as calm as the english habitually do whenever their pulse beats furiously    i d like to bet too   tess laughed  leaning across    what  the same sized bet     no  a hundred     dollars      rupees   she laughed    i m not so rich as my husband     can t refuse a lady   samson answered  noting the bet down    i shall be a rich man tonight   they play a brilliant game  those fellows  but we always beat them in the end     how do you account for that   dick asked  suspecting what was coming    oh  in a number of ways  but chiefly because they lack team loyalty among themselves   they re all jealous of one another  whereas our fellows play as a unit    as if in confirmation of samson s words the rajput team seemed rather to go to pieces in the third chukker   there was the same brilliant individual hitting  and as much speed as ever  but the genius was not there   in vain utirupa took the ball out of a scrimmage twice and rode away with it  he was not backed up in the nick of time  and before the end of the third minute the english scored    you d better go and hedge those bets   laughed samson when the chukker ended    there are plenty of the native gentry over yonder who d be delighted to gamble a fortune with you yet    dick scarcely heard   he was watching utirupa  who stood by the pony line where a sais was doing something to a saddle girth   a rangar came up to the prince and spoke to him  a slim  young looking man  a head the shorter of the two  with a turban rather low over his eyes  and the loose end of it  for some reason  across the lower half of his face  dick nudged tess  and she nodded   after that utirupa appeared to speak in low tones to each member of his own team    i beg your pardon   what was that you said   asked dick    i say you d better hedge those bets     i ll double with you  if you like     good heavens  man   i ve wagered a month s pay already   go and bet with willoughby de wing or one of the gunner officers    the rangar disappeared into the crowd before the teams rode out for the fourth encounter  and tess  who had made up her mind to watch the shuttered carriages that stood in line together in a roped enclosure of their own  became too busy with the game   something had happened to the rajputs   they no longer played with the gallery appealing smash and gallop fury that won them the first goal  although their speed held good and the stick work was marvelous   but they seemed more willing now to mix it in the middle of the field  and to ride off an opponent instead of racing for the chance to shine individually   it became the english turn to drive to the wings and try to clear the ball for a hurricane race down field   and they were not quite so good at those tactics as the other side were   all the rest of that game until the eighth  chukker after chukker  the rajputs managed to reverse the usual procedure  obliging the english team to wear itself out in terrific efforts to break away  tiring men and ponies in a tight scramble in which neither side could score    it looks like a draw after all   said samson    bets off in that case  i suppose  disappointing game in my opinion      tisn t over yet   said dick   the rajputs were coming out for the last chukker with their first and fastest ponies that had rested through the game   and they were smiling  utirupa had said something that was either a good joke or else vastly reassuring   as a matter of fact he had turned them loose at last to play their old familiar game again  and from the second that the ball went into play the crowd was on tiptoe  swaying this and that way with excitement   in vain the english sought to return to the scrimmage play   it was too late  the rajputs had them rattled   topham at full back on the pie bald was a stone wall  swift  hard hitting and resourceful  but in vain   swooping down the wings  and passing with the dextrous wrist work and amazing body bends that they alone seem able to accomplish  they put the english team on the defensive and kept them there   once  at about half time  by a dash all together the english did succeed in carrying t he ball down field  but that was their last chance  and they missed it  in the last two minutes the rajputs scored two goals  the last one driven home by utirupa himself  racing ahead of the field with whirling stick and the thunder of a neck and neck stampede behind him    that ll be your month s pay   laughed dick    i hope you won t starve for thirty days    the crowd went mad with delight  and swarmed on to the ground  shouting and singing   samson got up  looking as if he rather enjoyed to lose three thousand rupees in an afternoon    if you ll excuse me   he said  i ll go and shake hands with utirupa   he deserves congratulation   it was head work won that game     i wonder what she said to him at the end of the third chukker   tess whispered to dick   samson found utirupa giving orders to the saises  and shook hands with him    good game  utirupa   congratulate you   by the way   there s going to be a meeting on important business in my office half an hour from now  when you ve had a tub and a change  i wish you d come and join us  we want a word with you     where are the gunners going to   asked tess    the men who kept the line  look   they re all trooping off the ground in the same direction     dunno   said her husband    let s make for the dog cart and drive home  if we hang around samson ll think we re waiting for that money    half an hour after that  utirupa presented himself at samson s office in the usual neat rajput dress that showed off his lithe figure and the straightness of his stature   there was quite a party there to meet him   samson  willoughby de wing  norwood  sir hookum bannerjee  topham  still looking warm and rather weary after the game   and outside on the open ground beyond the compound wall two batteries of horse guns were drawn up at attention   but if utirupa felt surprise he did not show it    to make a short story of a long one  prince utirupa   samson began at once   as you know  gungadhura abdicated yesterday   the throne of sialpore is vacant  and you are invited to accept it   i have here the required authority from simla    utirupa rose from his chair  and bowed    i am willing to accep   he answered quietly   his face showed no emotion    there is one stipulation  though   said samson    we are tired of these foolish  islands   our territory in yours and yours in ours   there s a contract here   as your first official act  there s no time like the present  we want you to exchange the river palace  on this side of the river  for out fort on your side    utirupa said never a word    it s not a question of driving a bargain   samson went on    we don t know what the palace may be worth  or what is in it   if there is any valuable furniture you d like removed  we ll waive that point   but on the terms of the contract we exchange the fort  with the guns and whatever else is there except the actual harness and supplies of the garrison  against the land and palace and whatever it contains except furniture    utirupa smiled  perhaps because the guns in that fort were known to date from before the mutiny    will you agree     i will sign   said utirupa   and he signed the contract there and then  in presence of all those witnesses   ten minutes later  as he left the office  the waiting batteries fired him a fourteen gun salute  that the world might know how a new maharajah occupied the throne of sialpore   meanwhile  up at the house on the hill tess and dick found yasmini already there ahead of them  lying at her ease  dressed as a woman of women  and smoking a cigarette in the window seat of the bedroom tess had surrendered to her    what was it you said to him after the third chukker   was the first question tess asked    you recognized me     sure   so did my husband   what did you say to him     oh  i just said that if he hoped to win he must play the game of the english  and play it better  that was all   he won  didn t he   i didn t stay to the end   i knew he would win    almost as they spoke the fourteen gun salute boomed out from across the river  and echoed from the hills    ah   said yasmini    listen   the guns of the gods   he is maharajah now     but what of the treasure   tess asked her    dick told me this morning that the english have a guard all round the river palace  and expect to dig the treasure up themselves     perhaps the english need it more than he and i do   yasmini answered   that evening tom tripe turned up  and yasmini came down stairs to talk with him  trotters remaining outside the window with his ash colored hair on end and a succession of volcanic growls rumbling between flashed teeth    what s the matter with the dog  that he won t come in   asked tess    nothing  ma arm  he s just encouraging himself   he stays here tonight     trotters does   why     it s known all over sialpore that her ladyship s staying here  and gungadhura s at large somewhere   you re well guarded   that s been seen to  but trotters stays for double inner guard   one or two men might go to sleep   gungadhura might pass them a poisoned drink  or physic their rations in some way  and then   they re what you might call fixed point men here  one there  with instructions they ll be skinned alive and burned if they leave their exact position   trotters has a roving commission  to nose and snarl whenever he s minded   you can t poison him  for he won t eat from strangers   you can t see to knife him in the dark  because he s ash colored and moves too swift   and if gungadhura comes an  shoots at where trotters  eyes gleam  well  mr  dick blaine is liable to wake up an  show his highness how buffalo billy imitates a gatling gun   the house is safe  but i thought i d come and mention it     when will my palace be ready   yasmini asked    tomorrow or the next day  your ladyship   there wasn t so much taken out after all  though a certain amount was stolen   the first orders the new maharajah gave were to have your palace attended to   and some of the stolen stuff is coming in already   word went out that if stuff was returned there d be nothing said  but if it weren t returned there d be something brand new in the line of trouble for all concerned   the priests have been told to pass the word along    no obedience from priests  no priests at the coronation ceremony   it s my belief from about two hours  observation that we ve got a maharajah now with guts  if you ll excuse my bad french  please  ma am     what does it matter to you  tom  whether he is good or not   yasmini asked mischievously   isn t there a rumor that the english won t allow any but the native born instructors after this     ah  naughty  naughty   he laughed  shaking a gnarled forefinger   i thought it was your voice in the crowd   your ladyship  ud like to have me all nervous  wouldn t you   well  if tom tripe was out of a job tomorrow  the very first person he d apply to for a new one would be the princess yasmini   and she d give it him     what have you in your hand   yasmini asked    gungadhura s turban that he wore the night when akbar chased him down the street    yasmini nodded  understanding instantly   five minutes later  after a rousing stiff night cap  tom took his leave  they heard his voice outside the window    trotters    the dog s tail beat three times on the veranda    take a smell o  this    there was silence  followed by a growl    if he comes   kill him   d ye understand   kill him   there  there s the turban for you to lie on an  memorize the smell   kill him   ye understand    a deep growl was the answer  and tom tripe marched off toward the stables for his horse  whistling annie rooney  lest some too enthusiastic watcher knife him out of a shadow    when i am maharanee   said yasmini   tom tripe shall have the title of sirdar  whether the english approve of it or not        chapter twenty two     the creator caused flowers to bloom in the desert and buried jewels in the bosom of the earth   that is lest men should grow idle  wallowing in delights they have  instead of acquiring merit in the search for beauty that is out of reach     eastern proverb    making one hundred exactly    technically  yasmini was as much maharanee of sialpore as she would ever be  the moment that the fourteen gun salute boomed out across the river   for the english do not recognize a maharanee  except as courtesy title   the reigning prince is maharajah  and  being hindu  can have one wife or as many as he pleases   utirupa and yasmini claimed to have married themselves by gandharva rite  and  had she chosen  she could have gone to live with him that minute   but that would not have paid her in the long run   the priests  for instance  whom she despised with all her character  would have been outraged into life long enmity   and she knew their power    it is one thing   she told tess   to determine to be rid of cobras   but another to spurn them with your hand and foot   they bite    then again  it would not have suited her to slip quietly into utirupa s palace and assume the reins of hidden influence without the english knowing it   she proposed taking uttermost advantage of the purdah custom that protects women in india from observation and makes contact between them and the english almost impossible   but she intended  too  to force the indian government into some form of recognition of her    if they acknowledge me  they lock swords with every woman in the country   let them deny me afterward  and all those swords will quiver at their throats   a woman s sword is subtler than a man s     that was the secret of her true strength in all the years that followed  it was never possible to bring her quite to bay  because the women pulled hidden strings for her in the sphere that is above and below the reach of governments    so she moved back into her own palace  where she received only tess of all the anglo saxon women in india    why don t you keep open house to english women  and start something   tess asked her   but yasmini laughed    my power would be gone   do you fight a tiger by going down on all fours with him and using teeth and claws   or do you keep your distance  and use a gun     but the english women are not tigresses     if they were  i would laugh at them   trapping tigers is a task the jungle coolies can attend to well   but if i admit the english women into my palace  they will come out of curiosity   and out of pity  or compassion or some such odious emotion they will invite me to their homes  making an exhibition of me to their friends   should i be one of them   never  would they admit other indian women with me   certainly   any one i cared to recommend   they would encourage us to try to become their social equals  as they would call it  always backing away in front of us and beckoning  we striving  and they flattered   no   i will reverse that  i will have the english women striving to enter our society   they shall wake up one day to discover there is something worth having that is out of reach   then see the commotion   watch the alteration then  today they say  when they trouble to think of us at all   come and visit us  our ways are good   we will not hurt you   come along   as the children call to a kitten in the street   then they will say    we have this and that to offer   we desire your good society   will you admit us if we bring our gifts    that will be another story  but it will take time     more than time   tess answered    genius     i have genius   that is why i know too much to declare war on the priests  i shall have a proper wedding  and priests shall officiate  i despising them and they aware of it   that will be their first defeat   they shall come to my marriage as dogs come to their mistress when she calls   and be whipped away again if they fawn too eagerly   they will not dare refuse to come  because then war would be joined  and i might prove to people how unnecessary priests are   but they are more difficult to deal with than the english   a fat hypocrite like jinendra s high priest is like a carp to be caught with a worm  or an ass to be beaten with a stick  but there are others  true ascetics  lusting for influence more than a bellyful  caring nothing for the outside of the power if they hold the nut   nothing for the petals  if they hold the seed   those men are not easy  for the present i shall seem to play into their hands  but they know that i despise them    so great preparations were made for a royal wedding   and when samson heard that yasmini was to be utirupa s bride he was sufficiently disgusted  even to satisfy yasmini  who was no admirer of his   sita ram s account of samson s rage  as he explained the circumstance to willoughby de wing  was almost epic    damn the woman   and damn him   she s known for a trouble maker  simla will be asking me why on earth i permitted it   they ll want to know why i didn t caution utirupa and warn him against that princess in particular  she s going to parade through the streets under my very nose and in flat defiance of our government  just at the very time when i ve gone on record as sponsor for utirupa   i ve assured them he wouldn t do an ill advised thing  and i specifically undertook to see that he married wisely   but it was too early yet to speak to him about it   and here he springs this offense on me   it s too bad  too bad     you ll be all right with simla   said willoughby de wing    dig up the treasure and they ll recommend you for the k  c  b   with the pick of all the jobs going     they don t give k  c  b  s to men in my trade   samson answered rather gloomily    they reserve them for you professional butchers    he was feeling jumpy about the treasure  and dreaming of it all night long in a way that did not make the waking fears more comfortable  a whole company of sappers bad been sent for   and because of the need of secrecy for the present  a special appropriation had had to be made to cover the cost of lumber for the tunnel that dick began  and that the sappers finished   they had dug right up to the pipal trees  and half killed them by tunneling under their roots along one side   but without discovering anything so far  except a few old coins    the very ancient golden mohur in the glass case marked  sialpore  in the allahabad museum is one of them    now they were going to tunnel down the other side and kill the ancient trees completely   being a man of a certain courage  samson had it in mind  perhaps   to send the map to an expert for an opinion on it   only  he hated experts  they were so bent always on establishing their own pet theory   and it was late  a little late for expert opinions on the map   the wisest way was to keep silent and continue digging  even if the operation did kill ancient landmarks that one could see  from across the river  for instance   and  of course  he could not refuse to recognize the wedding officially and put on record the name  ancestry and title of the maharajah s legal first wife   nor could he keep away  because  with amazingly shrewd judgment  yasmini had contrived the novelty of welding wedding and coronation ceremony and festival in one   instead of two successive outbursts of squandering  there would be only one   it was economic progress   one could not withhold approval of it   he must go in person  smile  give a valuable present  paid for by the government  of course   and say the proper thing   one modicum of consolation did ooze out of the rind of samson s situation   it would have been no easier  be reflected  to say the right thing at the right time at the coronation ceremony  especially to the right people  if that treasure should already have been dug up and reposing in the coffers of the indian government   after a certain sort of bargain  one s tongue feels unpleasant in one s cheek   sialpore  however  was much more taken up with preparations for the colossal coronation wedding feast than with samson s digging   yasmini went on her palace roof each day to see how the trees leaned this and that way  as the earth was mined from under them   and tom tripe  standing guard on the bastion of the fort to oversee the removal of certain stores and fittings before the english should march out finally and the maharajah s men march in  could see the destruction of the pipal trees too   so  for that matter  could dick blaine  on the day when he took some of the gang and blocked up the mouth of the mine on the hill with cemented masonry  to prevent theft   and cursed himself afterward for being such a fool as to brick up his luncheon basket inside the tunnel  to say nothing of all the men s water bottles and some of their food and tools   but nobody else in sialpore took very much notice of samson s excavation  and nobody cared about dick s mine   every maharajah always tries to make his wedding and coronation ceremonies grander  and more extravagant and memorable than anybody s else have been since history began   and there are plenty whose interest it is to encourage him  and to help him do it   money lenders  for instance   but utirupa not only had two magnificent ceremonies to unite in one  but yasmini to supply the genius   the preparations made the very priests gasp  and they were used to orgies of extravagance   taught and preached and profited by them in fact    once or twice tess remonstrated  but yasmini turned a scornfully deaf ear    what would you have us do instead   invest all the money at eight per cent   so that the rich traders may have more capital  and found an asylum where bimbu  umra and pinga may live in idleness and be rebuked for mirth     bimbu  umra and pinga might be put to work   said tess    as for mirth  they laugh at such unseemly things   they could be taught what proper humor is     have they not worked   yasmini asked    has one man got into your house  without you  or the guard set to watch you  knowing it   could any one have done it better   did it not have to be done   as for humor   have they not enjoyed the task   has it not been a sweeter tale in their ears than the story teller s at the corner  because they have told it to themselves and acted a part in it     well   said tess   you can t convince me   there are institutions that could be founded with all that money you and your husband are going to spend on ceremony  that would do good     institutions    yasmini s eyes grew ablaze with blue indignant fire   there were institutions in this land before the english came  which need attention before we worry ourselves over new ones   play was one of them  and i will revive it first   the people used to dance under the trees by moonlight   do they do it now   it is true they used to die of famine in the bad years  growing much too fat in good ones  and the english have changed that   but i will give them back the gladness  if i can  that has been squeezed out by too many  institutions       you would rather see bimbu  umra and pinga happy  than prosperous and well clothed     which would you rather   yasmini asked her    you shall see them well clothed in a little while   just wait    there were almost endless altercations with the priests   utirupa himself was known to have profound sikh tendencies  a form of liberalism in religion that produced almost as much persecution at one time as protestantism did in europe   to marry a woman openly who had no true claim to caste at all  as yasmini  being the daughter of a foreigner  had not  was in the eyes of the priests almost as great an offense as yasmini s father s  who crossed the kali pani  ocean  and married abroad in defiance of them   so the priests demanded the most elaborate ritual of purification that ingenuity could devise  together with staggering sums of money   utirupa s eventual threat to lead a reform movement in rajputana brought them to see reason  however  and they eventually compromised  with a stipulation that the public should not be told how much had been omitted   there was feasting in the streets for a week before the great inauguration ceremony   tables were set in every side street  where whoever cared to might eat his fill of fabulous free rations   each night the streets were illuminated with colored lights  and fireworks blazed and roared against the velvet sky at intervals  dowering the ancient trees and temple tops with momentary splendor   all day long there were performances by acrobats  and songs  and story telling whenever there was room for a crowd to gather   faquirs as gruesome and fantastic as the side shows at a western fair flocked in to pose and be gaped at  receiving  besides free rations and tribute of small coin  gratification to their vanity in return for the edifying spectacle   there were little processions  too  of princes arriving from a distance to be present on the great day  their elephants of state loaded with extravagant gifts and their retainers vying with peacocks in efforts to look splendid  and be arrogant  and claim importance for their masters  never a day but three or four or half a dozen noble guests arrived  and nobody worked except those who had to make things easy for the rest   and they worked overtime   one accustomed spectacle  however  was omitted   utirupa would have none of the fights between wild animals in the arena that had formed such a large part of gungadhura s public amusement   but there was ram fighting  and wrestling between men such as sialpore had never seen  all the best wrestlers from distant parts being there to strive for prizes   hired dancers added to the gaiety at night  and each incoming nobleman brought nautch girls  or acrobats  or trained animals  or all three to add to the revelry   and there was cock fighting  and quail fighting  of course  all day long and every day  with gambling in proportion   when the day of days at last arrived the city seemed full of elephants  every compound and available walled space had been requisitioned to accommodate the brutes  and there were sufficient argumentative mahouts  all insisting that their elephants had not enough to eat  and all selling at least half of the pr vided ration  to have formed a good sized regiment   the elephants  daily bath in the river was a sight worth crossing india to see   there was always the chance  besides  that somebody s horses would take fright and add excitement to the spectacle   up in the great palace utirupa feasted and entertained his equals all day long  and most of the night   there was horse racing that brought the crowd out in its thousands  and a certain amount of tent pegging and polo  but most of the royal gala making was hidden from public view   patali  for instance  reckless of gungadhura s fall and looking for new fields to conquer  provided a nautch by herself and her own trained galaxy of girls that would not have done at all in public    yasmini kept close in her own palace   she  too  had her hands full with entertaining  for there were about a dozen of the wives of distant princes who had made the journey in state to attend the ceremony and watch it from behind the durbar grille  to say nothing of the wives of local magnates   but she herself kept within doors  until the night before the night of full moon  the day before the ceremony   that night she dressed as a rangar once more  and rode in company with tess and dick  with ismail the afridi running like a dog in the shadows behind them  to the fort on the hill that the english had promised to evacuate that night   they never changed the garrison in any case except by night  because of the heat and the long march for the men  and as near the full moon as possible was the customary date   as they neared the fort they could see tom tripe  with his huge dog silhouetted on the bastion beside him  standing like napoleon on the seashore keeping vigil   from that height he could oversee the blocked up mouth of dick s mine  and in the bright moonlight it would have been difficult for any one to approach either mine or fort without detection  for there was only one road  and dick s track making a detour from it   both in full view   he caught sight of them  and dick whistled  the dog answering with a cavernous howl of recognition   tom disappeared from the bastion  and after about ten minutes turned up in the shadow where they waited    come to watch the old march out and the new march in   he asked   i ll stand here with you  if i may   they re due     is everything ready   asked yasmini    yes  your ladyship   they ve been ready for an hour  and fretful  there s a story gone the rounds that the fort is haunted  and if ever a garrison was glad to quit it s this one   let s hope the incoming garrison don t get wind of it   a sepoy with the creeps ain t dependable   hullo  here they come    there came a sound of steady tramping up hill  and a bugle somewhere up in the darkness announced that the out going garrison had heard it and were standing to arms   presently utirupa rode into view accompanied by half a dozen of his guests  and followed by a company from his own army  officered by rajputs   if he knew that yasmini was watching from the shadow he made no sign  but rode straight on up hill   the heavy breathing of his men sounded through the darkness like the whispering of giants  and their steady tramp was like a giant s footfall   for tom tripe had drilled them thoroughly  even if their weapons were nearly as old fashioned as the fort to which they marched   after an interminable interval there came another bugle blast above them  and the departing garrison tramped within ear shot    now count them   yasmini whispered  and tess wondered why   they were marching down hill as fast as they could swing  a detachment of punjabi infantry under the command of a native subahdar  with two ammunition mules and a cartful of their kits and personal belongings   all talking and laughing as if regret were the last thing in their minds    ninety seven   said tess  when the last had passed down hill    did you count the man beside the driver on the cart     yes     there was one sick man in a dhoolie   did you count him     no     ninety eight  them tom     your ladyship     weren t there some english officers     two   a captain and a subaltern   they left late this afternoon     making   said yasmini    exactly a hundred   answered tess    let us go now   said yasmini    we must be up at dawn for the great day   i shall expect you very early  remember   tom   you may ride back with us   his highness will mount the guard in person   you re to come to my palace   i ve a present waiting for you        chapter twenty three     it is better to celebrate the occasion than to annoy the gods with pretended virtue and too many promises     eastern proverb  three amber moons in a purple sky   the day of the great inauguration ceremony dawned inauspiciously for somebody   for one thing  the blasting powder laid ready by the sappers under the pipal trees for explosion the day following  blew up prematurely  some idiot had left a kerosene lamp burning in the dug out  probably  and a rat upset it   or some other of the million possibilities took place  nobody was killed  but a dozen pipal trees were blown to smithereens  and the ghastly fact laid bare for all to see that in the irregular chasm that remained there was not a symptom of the treasure  as samson was immediately notified   so samson had to attend the ceremony with that disconcerting knowledge up his sleeve   but that was not all   the night signaler  going off duty  had brought him a telegram from the high commissioner to say that all available military bands were to be lent for the day to the maharajah  and that as many british officers as possible  of all ranks  were to take part in the procession to grace it with official sanctity   that was especially aggravating because it had reached his ears that the princess yasmini intended to ride veiled in the procession  and to sit beside her husband in the durbar hall unveiled   he was therefore going to be obliged to recognize her more or less officially as consort of the reigning prince   simla did not realize that  of course   but it was too late to wire for different instructions   he had a grim foreboding that he himself would catch it later on when the facts leaked out  as they were bound to do    it was babu sita ram who  caught it  first  though   within two days samson discovered that sita ram had been sending official telegrams in code on his own account  very cleverly designed to cause the high commissioner to give those last minute instructions   it was obvious that a keener wit than the babu s had inspired him   but  though he was brow beaten for an hour he did not implicate yasmini   and after he had been dismissed from the service with ignominy she engaged him as a sort of secretary  at the same pay    but that was not all  either   the murderer of mukhum dass was refusing stolidly to plead guilty to another charge  and blaine s butler had come out with the whole story of the burglary   parliament would get to hear about it next  and then there would be the very deuce to pay   the police were offering the murderer what they called  inducements and persuasion   but he held out for  money down   and did not seem to find too unendurable whatever it was that happened to him at intervals in the dark cell   there are limits even to what an indian policeman can do  without making marks on a man or compelling the attention of european officers   on top of all that  samson had to hand dick blaine a check amounting to a month s pay  look pleasant while he did it  and  above all  look pleasant at the coming durbar   on the other hand  there were people who enjoyed themselves   sialpore  across the river  was a dinning riot of excitement  flags  triumphal arches  gala clothes and laughter everywhere   dick blaine  driving tess toward yasmini s palace in the very early dawn  had to drive slowly to avoid accident  for the streets were already crowded   his own place in the procession was to be on horseback pretty nearly anywhere he chose to insert himself behind the royal cortege  and  not being troubled on the score of precedence  he had tom tripe in mind as a good man to ride with   tom could tell him things   but he waited there for more than an hour until the royal elephants arrived  magnificent in silver howdahs and bright paint  and watched tess emerge with yasmini and the other women   tess wore borrowed jewels  and a veil that you could see her face through   but yasmini was draped from head to foot as if the eyes of masculinity had never rested on her  and never might   things were not going quite so smoothly as they ought  although tom tripe was galloping everywhere red necked with energy  and it was nearly half an hour more before the escort of maharajah s troops came in brand new scarlet uniforms  to march in front  and behind  and on each side of the elephants   so dick got quite a chance to  josh  tess  and made the most of it   but things got under way at last   dick s sais found him with the horse he was to ride  and the procession gathered first on the great maidan  open ground  between the city and the river  with bands in full blast  drums thundering to split the ears  masters of ceremony shouting  and the elephants enjoying themselves most of all  as they always do when they have a stately part to play in company   utirupa led the way in a golden howdah on akbar  the biggest elephant in captivity and the very archetype of sobriety ever since his escapade with tom tripe s rum   akbar was painted all over with vermilion and blue decorations  and looked as if butter would not melt in his mouth   next after utirupa the princes rode in proper order of rank and precedence  each with two attendants up behind him waving fans of ostrich plumes  then came a band   then samson  and a score of british officers in carriages whose teams were nearly frantic from the din and the smell of elephants and had to have runners to hold their heads  all of which added exquisite amusement   then another band  and a column of the maharajah s troops   then more elephants  loaded with the lesser notables  and after them  a column nearly a mile long of rajput gentry on the most magnificent horses they could discover and go in debt for   after the rajput gentry came a third band  followed by more maharajah s troops  and then yasmini on her elephant  followed by twenty princesses and tess  each with a great beast to herself and at least two maids to wave the jeweled fans   then more troops  followed by dick and tom tripe together on horseback leading the rank and file   trotters jogged along between tom and dick  pausing at intervals to struggle with both forefeet to remove a collar bossed with solid gold that he regarded as an outrage to his dogly dignity   and the rank and file were well worth looking at  for whoever could find a decent suit of clothes was marching  shouting  laughing  sweating  kicking up the dust  and having a good time generally   the water sellers were garnering a harvest   fruit  and sweetmeat peddlers were dreaming of open fronted shops and how to defeat the tax collector   the police swaggered and yelled and ordered everybody this and that way   and nobody took the slightest notice   and the policemen did not dare do anything about it because the crowd was too unanimously bent on having its own way  and therefore dangerous to bully but harmless if not hit   half way down the thronging stream of men on foot came another elephant   a little one  alone  carrying three gentlemen in fine white raiment  bimbu and pinga and umra to wit  who  it is regrettable to chronicle  were very drunk indeed and laughed exceedingly at most unseemly jokes  exchanging jests with the crowd that would have made tess s hair stand on end  if she could have heard and understood them   from windows  and roofs that overhung the street  people threw flowers at bimbu  pinga and umra  because all hindustan knows there is merit in treating beggars as if they were noblemen   and bimbu wove himself a garland out of the buds to wear on his turban  which made him look more bacchanalian than ever   in and out and around and through the ancient city the procession filed  passing now and then through streets so narrow that people could have struck utirupa through the upper story windows   but all they threw at him was flowers  calling him  bahadur  and king of elephants  and great prince  and dozens of other names that never hurt anybody with a sense of pageantry and humor   he acted the part for them just as they wanted him to  sitting bolt upright in the howdah like a prince in a fairy story  with jeweled aigrette in his turban and more enormous diamonds flashing on his silken clothes than a courtesan would wear at monte carlo  and all the other princes were likewise in degree  only that they rode rather smaller elephants  akbar having no peer when he was sober and behaved himself   and when yasmini passed  and tess and all the other princesses  there was such excitement as surely had never been before   for if you looked carefully  with a hand held to keep the sun from your eyes  you could actually see the outlines of their faces through the veils   and such loveliness   such splendor   such pride   such jewels   above all  such fathomless mystery and suggestion of intrigue   pageantry is expensive  but  believe sialpore  it is worth the price   and then in front of the durbar hall in the dinning  throbbing heat  all the animals and carriages and men got mixed in a milling vortex  while the notables went into the hall to be jealous of one another s better places and left the crowd outside to sort itself   and everything was made much more interesting by the fact that akbar was showing signs of ill temper  throwing up his great trunk once or twice to trumpet dissatisfaction  his mahout was calling him endearing names and using the ankus alternately  promising him rum with one breath and a thrashing with the next   but akbar wanted alcohol  not promises  and none dared give him any before evening  when he might get as drunk as he wished in a stone walled compound all to himself   then samson s horses took fright at akbar s trumpeting  he getting out of the carriage at the durbar door only in the nick to time   the horses bolted into the crowd  and an indignant elephant smashed the carriage  but nobody was hurt beyond a bruise or two  although they passed word down the thunderous line that a hundred and six and thirty had been crushed to death and one child injured  which made it much more thrilling  and the sensation was just as actual as if the deaths had really happened   and inside the durbar hall there was surely never such a splendid scene in history  such a sea of turbans  such glittering of jewels  such a peacocking and swaggering and proud bearing of ancient names   utirtipa sat on the throne in front of a peacock feather decoration   and marvel of marvels   yasmini sat on another throne beside him  unveiled   with a genuine unveiled and very beautiful princess beside her  whom nobody except samson suspected might be tess   she wore almost as many jewels as the queen herself  and looked almost as ravishing   but the princess yasmini s eyes  they were the glory of that occasion  her spun gold hair was marveled at  but her eyes  surely they were lent by a god for the event   they were bluer than the water of himalayan lakes   bluer than turquoise  sapphire  the sky  or any other blue thing you can think of  laughing blue   loving  understanding  likable  amusing blue  two jewels that outshone all the other jewels in the durbar hall that day   and as each prince filed past utirupa in proper order of precedence  to make a polite set speech  and bow  and be bowed to in return  he had to pass yasmini first  and bow to her first  although he made his speech to utirupa  who acknowledged it   so  when samson s turn came  he  too  had to bow first to yasmini  because as a gentleman he could hardly do less   and her wonderful eyes laughed into his angry ones as she bowed to him in return  with such good humor and elation that he could not help but smile back   he could forgive a lovely woman almost anything  could samson   he could almost forgive her that no less than nineteen british officers of various ranks  as well as one hundred and three and twenty native noblemen had seen him with their own eyes to make an official bow to the consort of a reigning maharajah   he had recognized her officially   well   he supposed he could eat his aftermath as well as any man   and he drove home with a smile and a high chin  to unbosom himself to colonel willoughby de wing over a whisky and soda at the club  as ferdinand de sousa braganza reported in some detail at the goanese club afterward   late that night  when the fireworks were all over and the lights were beginning to be extinguished on the roofs and windows  it was a question which was most drunk  akbar  the three beggars  or tom tripe   akbar s outrageous trumpeting could be heard all over the city  as he raced around his dark compound after shadows  and rats  and mice and anything else that he imagined or could see   what tom tripe saw kept him to his quarters  where trotters watched him in dire misery   the three beggars  bimbu  pinga and umra  saw three amber moons in a purple sky  for they said so   they also said that all the world was lovely  and yasmini was a queen of queens  out of whose jeweled hand the very gods ate  and when people scolded them for blasphemy  they made such outrageously funny and improper jokes that everybody laughed again   drunk or sober  and more than ninety nine per cent  of sialpore was absolutely sober then as always  every one had something to amuse and entertain  except samson  whose mental vision was of a great empty hole in the ground in which he might just as well bury all his hopes of ever being high commissioner   and poor tom tripe  who had worked harder than anybody  and was now enjoying the aftermath perhaps least   sialpore put itself to bed in great good temper  sure that princes and elephants and ceremony were the cream of life  and that whoever did not think so did not deserve to have any pageantry and pomp  and that was all about it   next morning early  dick blaine drove down to look for tom tripe  found him  bound him in a blanket  shoved him  feet first  on to the floor of the dog cart  and drove him  followed by trotters in doubt whether to show approval or fight  to his own house on the hill  where tess and he nursed the old soldier back to soberness and old remorse   by that time bimbu and pinga and umra were back again at the garden gate  sitting in the dust in ancient rags and whining   bhig mangi  saheebi    alms  heavenborn  alms        chapter twenty four      you are a fool   said the crow    am i   the hen answered    certainly you are a fool   you sit in a dark corner hatching eggs  when there are live chickens for the asking over yonder    so the hen left her nest in search of ready made chickens  and the crow  made a square meat     eastern proverb   a hundred guarded it   it began to be rumored presently that utirupa had declined to recognize blaine s contract with his predecessor   samson s guarded hints  and the fact that the mouth of the mine remained blocked with concrete masonry were more or less corroborative   but the blaines did not go  although dick put in no appearance at the club   then patali  who was sedulously cultivating yasmini s patronage  with ulterior designs on utirupa that were not misunderstood  told norwood s wife s ayah s sister s husband that the american had secured another contract   and the news  of course  reached samson s ears at once   so samson called on utirupa and requested explanations   he was told that the mining contract had not received a moment s consideration and  with equal truth  that the american  being an expert in such matters and on the spot  had been asked to undertake examination of the fort s foundations   the new maharanee  it seemed  had a fancy to build a palace where the fort stood  and the matter was receiving shrewd investigation and estimate in advance   samson could not object to that   those foundations had not been examined carefully for eight hundred years   a perfectly good palace had been wrested away by diplomatic means  on samson s own initiative  and there was no logical reason why the maharajah should not build another one to replace it   the fort had no modern military value    i hope you re not going to try to pay for your new palace out of taxes   samson asked bluntly   but utirupa smiled   he hoped nothing of that kind would be necessary  samson could not go and investigate what blaine was doing  because he was given plainly to understand that the new palace was the maharanee s business   and one does not intrude uninvited into the affairs of ladies in the east   the efforts of quite a number of spies  too  were unavailing  so dick had his days pretty much to himself  except when tess brought his lunch to him  or yasmini herself in boots and turban rode up for a few minutes to look on   the guards on the bastions  and in the great keep in the center  knew nothing whatever of what was happening  because all dick s activity was underground and tom tripe  with that ferocious dog of his  kept guard over the ancient door that led to the lower passages  dick used to return home every evening tired out  but tom tripe  keeping strictly sober  slept in the fort and said nothing of importance to any one   he looked drawn and nervous  as if something had terrified him  but public opinion ascribed that to the  snakes  on the night of the coronation   then about sundown one evening tom tripe galloped in a great hurry to utirupa s palace   that was nothing to excite comment  because in his official capacity he was always supposed to be galloping all over the place on some errand or another   but after dark utirupa and yasmini rode out of the palace unattended  which did cause comment  yasmini in man s clothes  as usual when she went on some adventure   it was not seen which road they took  which was fortunate in the circumstances   tess was up at the fort before them  waiting with dick outside the locked door leading to the ancient passages below   they said nothing beyond the most perfunctory greetings  but  each taking a kerosene lantern  passed through the door in single file  tom leading  and locked the door after them   that was all that the fort guards ever knew about what happened    i ve not been in   said dick s voice from behind them    all i ve done is force an entrance    from in front tom tripe took up the burden    and i wouldn t have liked your job  sir   it was bad enough to sit and guard the door   after you d gone o  nights i d sit for hours with my hair on end  listening   and the dog  ud growl beside me as if he saw ghosts     maybe it was snakes   yasmini answered    they will flee from the lantern light      no  your ladyship   i m not afraid of snakes  except them scotch plaid ones that come o  brandy on top o  royal durbars   this was the sound o  some one digging  digging all night long down in the bowels of the earth   look out    they all jumped  but it proved to be only tom s own shadow that had frightened him   his nerves were all to pieces  and dick blaine took the lead   the dog was growling intermittently and keeping close to tom s heels   they passed down a long spiral flight of stone steps into a sort of cavern that had been used for ammunition room   the departing british troops had left a dozen ancient cannon balls  not all of which were in one place  the smooth flags of the floor were broken  and at the far end one very heavy stone was lifted and laid back  disclosing a dark hole    i used the cannon balls   said dick   to drop on the stones and listen for a hollow noise   once i found that  the game was simple    leading down into the dark hole were twelve more steps  descending straight  but turning sharply at the bottom   dick led the way    the next sight s gruesome   he announced  his voice booming hollow among the shadows   the passage turned into a lofty chamber in the rock  whose walls once had all been lined with dressed stone  but some of the lining had fallen  in the shadows at one end an image of jinendra smiled complacently  and there were some ancient brass lamps banging on chains from arches cut into the rock on every side    this is the grue   said dick  holding his lantern high   its light fell on a circle of skeletons  all perfect  each with its head toward a brass bowl in the center    ugh   growled tom tripe    those are the ghosts that dig o  nights  go smell  em  trotters   are they the enemy    the dog sniffed the bones  but slunk away again uninterested    nothing doing   laughed dick    you haven t laid the ghost yet  tom     have you got your pistols with you   tom retorted  patting his own jacket to show the bulge of one beneath it    those   said yasmini  standing between the skeletons and holding up her own light   are the bones of priests  who died when the secret of the place was taken from them   my father told me they were left to starve to death   this was jinendra s temple     d you suppose they pulled that cut stone from the walls  trying to force a way out   dick hazarded    the lid of the hole we came down through is a foot thick  and was set solid in cement   they couldn t have lifted that if they tried for a week   everything s solid in this place   i sounded every inch of the floor with a cannon ball  but it s all hard underneath     i would have gone straight to the image of jinendra   said yasmini   jinendra smiles and keeps his secrets so well that i should have suspected him at once     i went to that last   dick answered    it looks so like a piece of high relief carved out of the rock wall   as a matter of fact  though  it s about six tons of quartz with a vein of gold in it  see the gold running straight up the line of the nose and over the middle of the head   i pried it away from the wall at last with steel wedges  and there s just room to squeeze in behind it   beyond that is another wall that i had to cut through with a chisel   who goes in first     who looks for gold finds gold   yasmini quoted    the vein of gold you have been mining was the clue to the secret all along    she would have led the way  but utirupa stopped her    if there is danger   he said   it is my place to lead    but nobody would permit that  yasmini least of all    shall samson choose a new maharajah so soon as all that   she laughed    let the dog go first   tom proposed   trotters was sniffing at the dark gap behind jinendra s image  with eyes glaring and a low rumbling growl issuing from between bared teeth   but trotters would not go   finally  in the teeth of remonstrances from tess  dick cocked a pistol and  with his lantern in the other hand  strode in boldly   trotters followed him  and tom tripe next   then utirupa   then the women   nothing happened   the passage was about ten feet long and a yard wide  they squeezed one at a time through the narrow break dick had made in the end of it  into a high  pitch dark cave that smelt unexplainably of wood smoke  dick standing just inside the gap to bold the lantern for them and help them through  continuing to stand there after tess had entered last    jee rusalem   he exclaimed    this is where i lose out    the first glance was enough to show that they stood in the secret treasure vault of sialpore   there were ancient gold coins in heaps on the floor where they had burst by their own weight out of long demolished bags   countless coins   and drums and bags and boxes more of them behind  but what made dick exclaim were the bars of silver stacked at the rear and along one side in rows as high as a man    my contract reads gold   he said    a percentage of all gold   there s not a word in it of silver   who d ever have thought of finding silver  anyhow  in this old mountain     your percentage of the gold will make you rich   said utirupa    but you shall take silver too   without you we might have found nothing for years to come     a contract s a contract   dick answered    i drew it myself  and it stands     look out   yelled tom tripe suddenly   but the warning came too late   out of the shadow behind a stack of silver bars rushed a man with a long dagger  stabbing frantically at dick   tom s great barking army revolver missed  filling the chamber with noise and smoke  for he used black powder   down went dick under his assailant  and the dagger rose and fell in spasmodic jerks   dick had hold of the man s wrist  but the dagger point dripped blood and the fury of the attack increased as dick appeared to weaken   utirupa ran in to drag the assailant off  but trotters got there first  chose his neck hold like a wolf in battle  and in another second dick was free with tess kneeling beside him while a life and death fight between animal and man raged between the bars of silver    gungadhura   yasmini shouted  waving her lantern for a sight of the struggling man s face   he was lashing out savagely with the long knife  but the dog had him by the neck from behind  and he only inflicted surface wounds    hell s bells   he ll kill my dog   roared tom    hi  trotters   here  you  trotters    but the dog took that for a call to do his thinking   and let go for a better hold   his long fangs closed again on the victim s jugular  and tore it out  the long knife clattered on the stone floor  and then tom got his dog by the jaws and hauled him off    you can t blame the dog   he grumbled    he knew the smell of him  he d been told to kill him if he got the chance     gungadhura   said yasmini again  holding her lantern over the dying man   so gungadhura was tom tripe s ghost   what a pity that the dog should kill him  when all he wanted was a battle to the death with me   i would have given him his fight    dick was in no bad way   he had three flesh wounds on his right side  and none of them serious   tess staunched them with torn linen  and she and tom tripe propped him against some bags of bullion  while utirupa threw his cloak over gungadhura s dead body    how did gungadhura get in here   wondered tess    through the hole at the end of the mine shaft  i suppose   said dick   i built up the lower one  he came one day and saw me doing it  but left a space at the top that looked too small for a man to crawl through  then i blocked the mouth of the tunnel afterward  and shut him in  i suppose  he s had the men s rice and water bottles  and they left a lot of faggots in the tunnel  too  i remember   that accounts for the smell of smoke     but what was the digging i ve heard o  nights   demanded tom    i m not the only one   the british garrison was scared out of its wits    utirupa was hunting about with a lantern in his hand  watching the dog go sniffing in the shadows    come and see what he has done   he called suddenly  and yasmini ran to his side   in a corner of the vault one of the great facing stones had been removed  disclosing a deep fissure in the rock   one of dick blaine s crow bars that he had left in the tunnel lay beside it    he must have found that by tapping   said tom tripe    yes  but look why he wanted it   yasmini answered    tom  could you be as malicious as that     as what  your ladyship     see  he has poured gold into the fissure  hoping to close it up again so that nobody could find it     but why didn t he work his way out with the crow bar   dick objected from his perch between the bags of bullion    what was his life worth to him outside   yasmini asked    samson knew who murdered mukhum dass   he would have been a prisoner for the rest of his life to all intents and purposes   no   he preferred to hide the treasure again  and then wait here for me  suspecting that i knew where it is and would come for it   only we came too soon  before he had it hidden    but it was patali afterward  between boasting and confession  who explained that dick was gungadhura s real objective after all   he preferred vengeance on the american even to a settled account with yasmini   he must have found the treasure by accident after crawling into the unsealed crack in the wall to wait there against dick s coming    the money must stay here  and be removed little by little   said utirupa    first of all blaine sahib s share of it   yasmini added    who shall count it   who     never mind the money now   tess answered    dick s alive   when did you first know you d found the treasure  dick     not until the day that gungadhura found me closing up the fault  and asked me to dig at the other place   the princess told me i was on the trail of it that night that you went with her by camel   but i didn t know i d found it till the day that gungadhura came     how did you know where it was   tess asked  and yasmini laughed    a hundred guarded it   i looked for a hundred pipal trees  and found them  near the river palace   but they were not changed once a month  i looked from there  and saw another hundred pipal trees  here  below this fort  exactly a hundred   but neither were they changed once a month  then i counted the garrison of the fort  exactly a hundred  all told  then i knew   then i remembered that  who looks for gold finds gold   and saw your husband digging for it   it seemed to me that the vein of gold he was following should lead to the treasure  so i pulled strings until samson blundered  trying to trick us   and now we have the treasure  and the english do not know   and i am maharanee  as they do know  and shall know still better before i have finished   but what are we to do with gungadhura s body   it shall not lie here to rot   it must have a decent burial    very late that night  tom tripe moved the guards about on the bastions  contriving that the road below should not be overlooked by any one  the moon had gone down  so that it was difficult to see ten paces  he produced an ekka from somewhere  one of those two wheeled carts drawn by one insignificant pony that do most of the unpretentious work of india   and he and ismail  the afridi gateman  drove off into the darkness with a covered load   early next morning gungadhura s body was found in the great hole that samson s men had blasted in the river palace grounds  and it was supposed that a jackal had mangled his body after death    that was what gave rise to the story that the english got the treasure after all  and that gungadhura  enraged and mortified at finding it gone  had committed suicide in the great hole it was taken from   they call the great dead pipal tree that is the only one left now of the hundred  gungadhura s gibbet   and there is quite a number  even of english people  who believe that the indian government got the money   but i say no  because yasmini told me otherwise   and if it were true that t he english really got the money  what did they do with it and why was samson removed shortly afterward to a much less desirable post  any one could see how utirupa prospered  and he never raised the taxes half a mill   samson had his very shrewd suspicions  one of which was that that damned american with his smart little wife had scored off him in some way  but he went to his new post  at about the same time that the blaines left for other parts  with some of the sting removed from his hurt feelings  for he took blaine s rifle with him  a good one   and the horse and dog cart  and a riding pony  more than a liberal return for payment of a three  thousand rupee bet   pretty decent of blaine on the whole  he thought  no fuss   no argument   simply a short note of farewell  and a request that he would  find the horses a home and a use for the other things   not bad   not a bad fellow after all

vision into swords of dull routine  take the trolley and the train to suburban hives again  for ye wake in little runnels where the floods of thought have been   speed  noise  efficiency   have flights of fancy rested you  a while we set time s finger back  and was the labor vain  if so we whiled your leisure and the puppets gave you pleasure  then say the word  good people  and we ll set the stage again    and that is the whole story  smoking a cigarette lazily on utirupa s palace roof  yasmini reached for tess s hand    come nearer   see  take this   it is the value  and more  of the percentage of the silver that your husband would not take    she clasped a diamond necklace around tess s neck  and watched it gleam and sparkle in the refracted sunlight    don t you love it   aren t they perfect   and now  you ve a great big draft of money  so i suppose you re both off to america  and good by to me forever     for a long time     but why such a long time   you must come again soon   come next year  you and i love each other   you teach me things i did not know  and you never irritate me   i love you   you must come back next year    tess shook her head    but why     they say the climate isn t good for them until they re eighteen at least   some say twenty     oh  oh  i envy you   what will you call him   it will be a boy  it is sure to be a boy     richard will be one name  after my husband     and the other   you must name him after me in some way   you can not call a boy yasmini   would utirupa sound too strange in america     rupert would sound better     good   he shall be rupert  and i will send a gift to him     that accounts for the initials r  r  b  on a certain young man s trunk at yale  and for the imported pedigree horse he rides during vacation   the third one  by the way  of a succession he has received from india    and that is the whole story  as yasmini told it to me in the wonderful old palace at buhl  years afterward  when utirupa was dead  and the english government had sent her into forced seclusion for a while  to repent of her manifold political sins  as they thought  and to start new enterprises as it happened   she had not seen theresa blaine again  she told me  although they always corresponded   and she assured me over and over again  calling the painted figures of the old gods on the walls to witness  that but for theresa blaine s companionship and affection at the right moment  she would never have had the courage to do what she did  even though the guns of the gods were there to help her    the end         end of the
